        <details class="doc_details"><summary>CSV</summary>
        CSV stands for "Comma Separated Value". It is a file format for spreadsheets
        and some other two-dimensional data using programs.
        Both MicroSoft Excel and Apple Numbers spreadsheets can read and write CSV files.
        <p></p>
        CSV is not a tight standard. There are variants so beware.
        DDE's CSV methods convert a string of CSV into a two dimensional array,
        and converts 2 dimensional arrays into strings.
        These functions are simple, not meant to handle complex data or lots
        of variants.
            <details class="doc_details"><summary>array_to_csv</summary>
            Converts a two dimensional array into a string that has
            its rows separated by the newline character, \n and
            the "cells" within each row separated by commas.<br/>
            <i>Parameter:</i></br/>
            <b>an_array</b> The array is expected to be two dimensional
            with the outer arrays representing rows, and
            the inner arrays representing cells.<br/>
            <i>Example:</i>
            <pre><code>array_to_csv([["head one", "head two"],
              [10, 20], [100, 200]])    </code></pre> =>
            <samp>`head one,head two\n10,20\n100,200`</samp> <br/>
            Note that there are no quotes around the string values of "head one" and "head two".
            If this string is read in by <code>csv_to_array</code>,
            "head one" and "head two" will be strings and the other values
            will be numbers.
            <p></p>
            You can use DDE's <a href="#" onclick="open_doc(write_file_doc_id)">write_file</a>
            to write the result of calling <code>array_to_csv</code> to a file.
            </details>
            <details class="doc_details"><summary>csv_to_array</summary>
                Converts a string of csv format into a two dimensional array.
                If the string has a newline char, \n, then newline is used
                for the row separator, otherwise \r is used.
                (Excel uses \r.)<br/>
                If the string has a comma char, then comma is used as the
                separator between cells in a row, otherwise tab, \t, is used.
                <br/>
                <i>Parameter:</i></br/>
                <b>a_string</b> The string is expected to have newlines or \r separate rows
                and commas or tab characters separate cells within a row.<br/>
                <i>Example:</i>
                <code>csv_to_array(`head one,head two\n10,20\n100,200`)</code> <br/>=>
                <samp>[["head one", "head two"], [10, 20], [100, 200]])</samp>
                Note that the numbers in the csv are converted to JS numbers,
                and the other values are left as strings.
                <p></p>
                You can use DDE's <a href="#" onclick="open_doc(read_file_doc_id)">read_file</a>
                to get the content of a csv file, then pass it to <code>csv_to_array</code> to

        <details class="doc_details"><summary>File Access</summary>
        Web clients reading an writing files to their local file system has been impossible in the past.
        DDE gives you programmatic read/write access to all files under the dde_apps folder
        under your Documents folder, typically under the user's home folder.
        <p></p>
        The code for your Job definitions should live under that folder (at any depth beneath
        that folder).
        If you do not have a dde_apps folder under your Documents folder, please create one.

        <details id="choose_file_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>choose_file</summary>

        <details id="dde_apps_folder_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>dde_apps_folder</summary>
            <code>dde_apps_folder</code> is a global constant whose value is a string
            of the name of the folder beneath which DDE has programmatic access.
            You cannot set this constant. It will have a value something like:
            <code>"/Users/Fry/Documents/dde_apps"</code> on the Mac.
        </details>

        <details id="read_file_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>read_file</summary>
            <code>read_file</code> is a function that takes an argument of a file path,
            and returns a string of the content of the file.<br/>
            <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
            <b>path</b> A string of a path to the file. Usually this will not start with a slash,
            but rather tha first character of a file name inside of your dde_apps folder.
            if the path starts with a slash, it should be a complete path from the root
            of your file system, on through to dde_apps and the file below it.
            <br/>
            <b>encoding</b> A string indicating the encoding of the file. Default: "utf8".
            The default works fine for most plain text files, including .js files.
            <p></p>
            <b>Example:</b> <code>read_file("dde_init.js")</code>
            <p></p>
            See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc(load_files_doc_id)">load_files</a>

        <details id="Editor.edit_file_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>Editor.edit_file</summary>
            <code>Editor.edit_file</code> takes an argument of a filepath, similar to <code>load_files</code>,
            and puts that file in DDE's editor.
            <p></p>
            Its 2nd argument is a callback that takes no arguments. It is called when the file's content
            is in DDE's editor.<br/>
            <b>Example:</b> <code>Editor.edit_file("dde_init.js")</code> edits the
            file Documents/dde_apps/dde_init.js<br/>
            You can also edit docs in subfolders, ie <code>"my_fold/junk.js"</code>

        <details id="file_exists_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>file_exists</summary>
        Returns true if the file path in the first argument exists.<br/>
        <I>Example</i>:<br/>
        <code>file_exists("dde_init.js")</code> => true
        </details>

        <details id="folder_separator_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>folder_separator</summary>
            A function of no arguments that returns the character used to separate folders in a filepath.
            For Windows OS's this is "\\" (backslash).
            For others its "/" (forward slash).
        </details>

        <details id="load_files_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>load_files</summary>
            <code>load_files</code> gets the content of files from disk
            (expected to be JavaScript) and evaluates
            it in the DDE environment programmatically. You can pass any number of file paths to
            load files. It will load the files sequentially, such that later files
            can depend on the contents of earlier files loaded.
            <p></p>
            File paths that start with slash are absolute and have no prefix prepended to them.
            File paths that don't start with slash have a prefix appended to them.
            The default prefix is the value of <code>dde_apps_folder + "/"</code>
            A file path that is exactly <code>"/"</code> sets the prefix
            to the default.
            <p></p>
            File paths that end in slash don't load files but do set the prefix to be
            prepended for files in later args.
            If such a file path starts with slash, it becomes the prefix
            (other than <code>"/"</code> , see above).
            If not, the new prefix is <code title="unEVALABLE">dde_apps_folder + "/" + path</code>
            This saves repetition of long folder names.
            <p></p>
            <i>Examples</i>:<br/>
            <code title="not in TestSuite"> load_files("foo.js")</code> Loads the file in your dde_apps folder named foo.js<br/>
            <pre style="background-color:white;"><code title="not in TestSuite"> load_files(
 "c.js",   //loads .../dde_apps/c.js
 "a/b.js", //loads .../dde_apps/a/b.js
 "d/e/",   //no load but sets prefix to ".../dde_apps/d/e/"
 "f.js,    //loads .../dde_apps/d/e/f.js
 "g.js",   //loads .../dde_apps/d/e/g.js
 "/",      //no load but sets prefix to .../dde_apps/
 "h.js"    //loads .../dde_apps/h.js
)
</code></pre>
            <p></p>
            load_files <i>tries</i> to return the result of evaluating the last top level expression in the last file loaded.
            <span style="color:red;">Warning</span>: Sometimes the last expression
            is NOT returned, so if you really want a returned value,
            its safer if the file contains only ONE top level expression.
            <p></p>
            It is conventional to use a file extension of ".js" for files containing JavaScript,
            but not strictly necessary.
            <p></p>
            See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc(read_file_doc_id)">read_file</a>

        Creates potentially nested folders in the file system.<br/>
        <i>Parameter:</i><br/>
        <b>path</b> Required. Similar to other DDE file utilities, if the
        path doesn't start with "/", the top level folder name in path
        is created under the Documents/dde_apps folder. If specified folders already exist,
        they are ignored, but subsequent folder names in the path are created under
        the existing folders.<br/>
        <i>Example:</i><br/>
        <code title="not in TestSuite">make_folder("foo/bar/baz")</code>

        Arguments:<br/>
        <b>filepath</b> The location to save to. It will overwrite the current content.
        Defaults to the file currently in the

        <b>content</b> A string of the content you wish to be in the written file.
        Defaults to the text currently in the editor.<br/>
        Examples: <br/>
        <code>write_file("no_exist.js", "stuff")</code> Creates the named file and gives it a content of "stuff".<br/>
        <code>write_file("junk.js")</code> Gives foo.js the content now in the editor.
        This is the <i>save_as</i> functionality.<br/>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Gamepad & Keyboard</summary>
The handheld gamepad, popular in video games, are surprisingly
sophisticated input devices. They differ from keyboards in that
they have fewer keys, have some "analog" joysticks, and are usually
not "event" based like a keyboard, but rather "polled" to see
what buttons are currently pressed.
<p></p>
DDE supports gamepads in this "currently pressed" mode.
DDE also can use the computer keyboard for similar "real time" input.
It is even easy to write one program that can use either
a gamepad, your computer keyboard, or both.
Because connectivity between a computer and a gamepad can
be problematic, having the option of "both" aids testing
and reliability.
    <details class="doc_details"><summary>Gamepad Setup</summary>
        Gamepads differ in number and names of keys. DDE assumes
        an XBOX One or XBOX 360 gamepad. Though we have not done
        extensive testing, probably many other gamepads will work.
        These plug into a computer via their USB connector.
        <p></p>
        Windows OS supports gamepads natively. MacOS requires
        that you install driver software.
        For XBOX One & 360 gamepads, you can get a free driver
        <a href="https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <p></p>
        To "initialize" the gamepad, you must press a key on it before
        you start using it. It doesn't matter which key you press.
        If DDE is not detecting key presses, try unplugging and replugging
        the gamepad USB connector and pressing a key again.
    </details>
    <details class="doc_details"><summary>down_keys</summary>
        <code>Gamepad.down_keys</code> is the primary interface
        to both gamepads and keyboards. It returns an array of literal objects
        that represent the keys on the keyboard and/or gamepad that
        are pressed when this method is called.
        <p></p>
        <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
        <b>device</b> A string that determines which
        devices have their keys monitored. Valid values are <code>"keyboard"</code>,
        <code>"gamepad"</code> and <code>"keyboard_gamepad"</code>, the default.
        The default allows you to use both gamepad and keyboard simultaneously.<br/>
        <b>which_gamepad</b> You can have up to 4 gamepads plugged in to your computer,
        named 0, 1, 2, and 3. <code>0</code> is the default.
        <p></p>
        <i>Returned value:</i><br/>
         <code>Gamepad.down_keys</code> returns an array
        of 0 or more literal objects, each representing a key that is down.
        The properties of these objects are:<br/>
        <b>device</b> <code>"keyboard"</code> or <code>"gamepad"</code> of the down key.<br/>
        <b>gamecode</b> An integer, usually between 0 and 16 inclusive, indicating
          the button on the gamepad that is pressed, or its equivalent from
          a keyboard key pressed. Not all keyboard keys have an equivalent gamepad button.<br/>
        <b>gamename</b> A string corresponding to the gamepad button pressed
                        or its equivalent from a keyboard key pressed.<br/>
        <b>keycode</b> An integer indicating a key on the keyboard that is pressed,
                        or its equivalent on a gamepad.
                       Note this is <i>not</i> an ascii number though keycodes are similar.
                       There are 256 possible keycodes, ranging from 0 to 255.
                       More than half (especially the upper half) are rarely used. <br/>
        <b>keyname</b> A string indicating the key on the keyboard that is pressed,
                      or its equivalent on a gamepad. For keys that have a name printed
                      on them, this is that name.
                      <p></p>
                      Note that the standard QWERTY keyboards
                      have many design deficiencies. Relevant here is the fact that
                      keys indicating letters are generally labeled with their
                      upper case equivalent, even though just pressing the key gives
                      you a lower case letter. None-the-less, the keyname for lettered
                      keys is the upper case letter. For keys with two names, (i.e. 2 and @)
                      the keyname is the unshifted (lower) name (i.e. 2).
                      <p></p> The space bar is named <code>" "</code>. Other names are multi-lettered,
                      upper case with underscores separating words (i.e. <code>"BACK_SPACE"</code>).
                      <br/>
        <b>value</b> A number. For most keys this is <code>1</code> indicating that
                 its down. It would be <code>0</code> when its up, but
                 down_keys only tells you about down keys.<br/>
                 Gamepad "LEFT_TRIGGER" and "RIGHT_TRIGGER" are a float varying between 0 and 1.

        <details class="doc_details"><summary>stop_remembering_keydown</summary>
        <code>Gamepad.stop_remembering_keydown</code> is used to
        end the handling of keyboard down keys. Call this when
        the part of your program that uses keyboard keys for
        real-time apps is done. It takes no arguments.
    </details>
    <details class="doc_details"><summary>Job with wait_until</summary>
     This simple example of wrapping <code>Gamepad.down_keys</code>
     in a Job is not good for constructing instructions, but
     is useful for learning and when you don't need to
     extend a Job's do_list.
     <p></p>
     If the function arg to <code>Control.wait_until</code> returns false when it is called
     by the job running process, the Job continues
     waiting. Hit the ESC key on the keyboard to end the wait_until.
     Because <code title="not in TestSuite">Gamepad.down_keys()</code>
     has its first arg default to <code>"gamepad_keyboard"</code>,
     you can use either a gamepad or the keyboard, though
     as written, you must use the keyboard to end the wait_until.
     <!-- not in TestSuite because it runs jobs and this job waits for user interaction -->
    <pre><code title="not in TestSuite">new Job({
  name: "gamepad_job1",
  do_list: [IO.out("Press RIGHT arrow or ESC to exit."),

    <details class="doc_details"><summary>Job with generator</summary>
    Using a generator makes it relatively easy to add instructions
    to the Job based on keystrokes. The <code>Dexter.move_all_joints_relative</code>
    calls create instructions which are "yielded" i.e. returned from the generator
    and added to the Job's do_list each time an appropriate key or gamepad button
    is pressed.
    <p></p>
    These calls just rotate a Dexter join by 1 degree so it moves slowly.
    You can increase that 1 degree to move faster.
    The Job's argument of <code title="unEVALable JS fragment">inter_do_item_dur: 0.05</code>

<details id="out_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>out</summary>
    <code>out</code> prints html that is rendered in the Output pane.<br/>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>val</b> Default: <code>""</code>. The JavaScript data to be printed.
               Typically this is a string.<br/>
    <b>color</b> Default: <code>"black"</code>. The color of the text to be printed.<br/>
    <b>temp</b> Default: <code>false</code>. With the default, printed output stays in the
       Output pane until DDE is relaunched.
       <p></p>
       If temp is <code>true</code>,
       then <b>val</b> is still printed in the Output pane, but is over-ridden
       by subsequence calls to out with temp == true. Calls to out with temp == false
       will erase any "temp" output.
       <p></p>
       If temp is a string, then out prints <b>val</b> similarly to temp == true in that
       the previous call to out with that temp string will be over-ridden in place.
       However, when another call to out with a different value for temp occurs,
       the output of out with a temp string will <i>not</i> be erased.
       Thus the last call to out with a given temp string remains in the Output pane,
       in its place, regardless of other out calls.<br/>
    <b>code</b> A boolean or null. Default: <code>null</code>. A <code>false</code> value renders the
    first argument's string as HTML. <code>true</code> renders the
    string as code. Newline chars actual cause a newline in the output
    and HTML tags are shown as their source code, not rendered HTML.
    A <code>true</code> value is useful for some kinds of debugging.
    <p></p>
    A <code>null</code> value looks at the value of the "Code" checkbox
    in the Output pane header to get its real value. The checked or uncheched status
    (true or false) is saved persistently accross DDE sessions.
    If the checkbox is checked, <code>out</code> behaves as if its code
    argument was <code>true</code>, otherwise as if its code argument was <code>false</code>.
    <p></p>
    <i>Example:</i><code>out("hi", "blue")</code><p></p>
    If you have a lot of out calls, it can be helpful to give them
    different colors so you can easily find a particular one.

    <details class="doc_details"><summary>Persistent Database</summary>
        DDE has a very simple database, whose values remain in tact accross DDE sessions.
        The DB stores a JSON object. The top level is a literal object
        with string keys and values that can be any JSON objects, including null, booleans,
        numbers, strings, arrays and other literal objects nested as deep as you like.
        It is not meant to store a large amount of data, mostly preferences and
        small objects.
        <p></p>
        The DB is stored in the file <code>"dde_apps/persistent.json"</code> as plain text.
        You can view the entire by opening it in DDE's editor if you like.
        However, we do not recommend editing it from DDE. That's because
        any changes will be overwritten the next time something is written
        to the DB by DDE. If you'd like to edit it as a file,
        close DDE and edit it with another editor. Be careful to
        get the JSON syntax correct.

        <details id="persistent_get_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>persistent_get</summary>
            Retreives a literal that was set with <code>persistent_set</code>
            The argument is the key to retreive. Its default value is <code>"get_all"</code>
            which gets a JavaScript literal object that has key-value pairs for all the
            calls to <code>persistent_set</code>. If a key is not in the database,
            <code>undefined</code> will be retreived.
            <p></p>
            persistent_get returns the value of the variable in the argument.<br/>
            <b>Example:</b> <br/>
            <code>persistent_set("test4", 44)</code><br/>
            <code>persistent_get("test4")</code> => <samp>44</samp><br/>

            If the argument is true, (the default), it will
            ensure that specific required properties exist, and if not,
            set them to their default value.<br/>
            If the argument is false, it will remove all the existing persistent properties
            and set the required properties to their default values.
            <p></p>
            <b>Warning:</b> DDE uses the persistent db to store the keys of edited files amongst
            other things, so an argument of false will get rid of your editing history.
            <i>This function should only rarely, if ever, called by users.</i>

        <details id="persistent_remove_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>persistent_remove</summary>
            Removes the binding between the first argument (key) and a stored value in the persistent db.<br/>
            <b>Example:</b> <code>persistent_remove("test4")</code><br/>
            After such a call, attempting to retreive the value of that key will get <code>undefined</code>.

        <details id="persistent_save_doc_id" style="margin-left:40px;"><summary>persistent_save</summary>
            Saves all persistent values to the file dde_apps/persistent.json.
            This function is called automatically when you call <code>persistent_set</code>.
            If you modify (not set) a persistent value that is an array or a literal object,
            call this function to save it. If you have a bunch of such modifications,
            do them all, then call <code>persistent_save</code> once at the end.<br/>

<details id="Picture_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Picture</summary>
The web has a long and tortured history of using images.
This undesigned mess consists of:
<ul>
<li>Numerous file formats: jpeg, png, gif, etc.</li>
<li>Numerous video formats.</li>
<li>3 HTML tags: img, canvas, video.</li>
<li>No good internal representation standard.</li>
<li>Asynchronous interfaces that make grown men cry.</li>
</ul>
On top of that mess we'd like to do conceptually simple tasks like
show pictures, videos, and take pictures. We'd
also like to do complex machine vision tasks such as recognize
objects.
<p></p>
DDE attempts to make this reasonable with our Picture class,
associated Robot instructions and OpenCV.js. Please understand
that this is not nearly as easy as you can imagine and will
no doubt have unexpected behavior. But we're doing the best we can
from the perplexing foundation we're building upon.

<details id="Picture.init_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>init</summary>
Before Picture methods can be used,<br/>
<code>&nbsp;Picture.init() </code><br/> must be evaled.
It takes a few seconds because it loads in OpenCV.js and other libraries.
The 2nd through nth times it is called, it does nothing and
returns very quickly so no harm in calling it multiple times a session.
<p></p>
Picture.init need not be called for the Robot instructions

<code>Picture.show_picture()</code><br/>
 pops up a window that displays an image.<br/>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
<b>canvas_id</b> Default: <code>"canvas_id"</code> The string id to
a canvas dom element, or a canvas dom element itself, to render the
picture in. If this is a string that is NOT the id of a canvas dom element,
such a dom element will be created inside a new show_window and used to
display the image. The id of that dom element will be the canvas_id.<br/>
This makes it easy to show pictures in a given place, or make a new place.<br/>

<b>content</b> The picture to be shown. The default is:<br/>
<code>__dirname + "/examples/snickerdoodle_board.png"</code>
which is a picture of a printed circuit board similar to Dexter's processor board
that is included in DDE. You can also show pictures stored in your dde_apps folder
by using their name (without a prefix).
Content can also be a url or OpenCV.js's "mat" object.<br/>

<b>title</b> Default: <code>undefined</code>. If undefined or null, and a new window is
created for showing this picture, a title for the window will be made up
based on the <i>content</i> arg. If its a string, that string will be shown in the title.<br/>

<b>x</b> Default: <code>200</code> If a new window is created, the x location
    of that window. 0 means left.</b><br/>

<b>y</b> Default: <code>40</code> If a new window is created, the y location
    of that window. 0 means top.<br/>

<b>width</b> Default: <code>320</code>.  If a new window is created, the width
    of the image shown in that window.<br/>

<b>height</b> Default: <code>240</code>.  If a new window is created, the height
    of the image shown in that window.<br/>

<b>rect_to_draw</b> Default: <code>null</code>. If this is an array of 4 non-negative integers,
it is used to make a single pixel wide red box at the
x, y, width and height specified in the array.<br/>
<b>show_window_callback</b> Default <code>show_window_callback_for_canvas_click</code>.
If canvas_id does not exist, a new show_window will be created that has an HTML canvas
tag that displays the content image. That show_window gets its callback argument
from this argument.
<p></p>
The default prints details about the pixel clicked on,
into the Output pane. View its source (by selecting and Evaling the function's name)
to see how you might write
a custom callback that does what you want with the clicked on pixel.
<i>Examples</i><br/>
<code>Picture.show_picture()</code><br/> Uses all the defaults.
<pre><code>Picture.show_picture({content:
"https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png"})</code></pre>
  A picture from the web you've seen before.<p><p/>
<pre><code>Picture.show_picture({content: __dirname + "/examples/snickerdoodle_board.png",
rect_to_draw:[20, 20, 50, 50]})</code></pre>
A picture file in DDE.<p><p/>
<pre><code>Picture.show_picture({canvas_id: "mycan", x: 20, y: 100,

<details id="Picture.show_video_cameras_doc_id"class="doc_details">
         <summary>show_video_cameras</summary>
A given computer may have 0 or more cameras.
If you don't have one on your computer, "webcams" that plug into
a USB port are cheap and plentiful. We bought a Logitec c170 Webcam for $20
in June, 2018. It has 640 x 480 video resolution and works fine with the DDE software.
<br/>
A higher end camera, especially good for pictures of tiny objects that
we've used is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Opti-Tekscope-Digital-Microscope-Definition-1600x1200/dp/B00PEZ3GMK/ref=pd_sbs_421_7">
Opti-Tekscope</a>
<p></p>
Even if you do have a webcam on your computer, you may want one or more to attach
to your Dexter. The above Logitec has a small table top stand. If you hacked
that off, you'd be left with a 2 inch wide, 1 inch high, 1/2 inch deep camera.
<p></p>
Its 3 foot USB cord isn't long enough to allow mounting on Dexter, but you can
get USB extention cables. We have seen 10 feet long USB cables work.
The USB 2 spec says 16 feet is the maximum length. USB 2 is the most common
version in use in 2018, but USB 3 is the new version and it is not recommended
to be longer than 10 feet.
<p></p>
The "default" webcam for the DDE software will be the one built-in to
your computer (if any). But if you're attaching a webcam to a computer,
you'll have to specify the ID of the camera you intend to use.<br/>
<code> Picture.show_video_cameras() </code></br> prints out a list of the video cameras
that are currently connected to your computer. Each camera has a:
<ul>
<li><b>kind</b> Always "videoinput"</li>
<li><b>label</b> For the Logitec, this is: "Webcam C170 (046d:082b)"</li>
<li><b>deviceId</b> A 50 character or so random string containing digits and lower case letters.
  I guess this is a unique ID. Its certainly long enough.
  This string can be used for the camera_id input for
  <code title="unEVALable">show_video</code> and
  <code title="unEVALable">take_picture</code>.
  Copy it from DDE's output pane and paste it into your camera_id argument.</li>
</ul>
<i>Parameter:</i><br/>
<b>callback</b> Default: <code>null</code>. If present, this
is a function that takes one argument, an array of camera "devices".
Each device is represented as a literal object with properties of kind, label, deviceId,
all with string values.<br/>
<i>Example:</i>
<pre><code>Picture.show_video_cameras(
        function(cams){
          out("You've got " +
              cams.length +
              " cameras.")})
        </code></pre>
</details>

<details  id="Picture.show_video_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>show_video</summary>
In order to take a picture for machine vision, you need to set up a video
stream and take a snapshot of it. This is quite difficult using web-based
sofware so we've made a wrapper for it.<br/>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
<b>video_id</b> Default: <code>"video_id"</code>. The location
that the video will be put in. This can be the id of a dom element
or the dom element object itself. If you give an id string
that does not have a corresponding dom element, a new
one will be made and wrapped in a show_window.
<br/>
<b>content</b> Default: <code>"webcam"</code> Where
the content displayed in the video_id will come from.
This can be the url or file name of a video file.
If its value is "webcam" (the default), the "content" will come from a webcam.
But your computer can have multiple webcams.
The actual webcam used is specified in the <i>camera_id</i> argument.
If you let camera_id default, the default webcam for your computer
will be used, but you can supply another one. See the doc for <i>camera_id</i> below.
<p></p>
For grabbing urls from <a target="_blank" href="http:www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>:
<ol><li>Click right on a video for a menu of operations.</li>
    <li>Click on "Copy video URL".</li>
    <li>Paste the string into the content argument in a call to show_video.</li>
</ol>
<b>title</b> A string. Default: <code>undefined</code> which will make a title
based on the <i>content</i> arg.<br/>
<b>x</b> Default: <code>400</code> The horizontal position of the show_window
  created if the video_id does not refer to an existing dom element.
  0 is on the left.<br/>
<b>y</b> Default: <code>0</code> The vertical position of the show_window
    created if the video_id does not refer to an existing dom element.
    0 is on the top. <br/>
<b>width</b> Default: <code>320</code>The width of the video element
    created if the video_id does not refer to an existing dom element.<br/>
<b>height</b> Default: <code>240</code> The height of the video element
    created if the video_id does not refer to an existing dom element.<br/>
<b>play</b> Default: <code>true</code> If true, the
video is played as soon as the display can handle it.<br/>
<b>camera_id</b> Default: <code>undefined</code> If the content is
    <code>"webcam"</code>, then this is the id of the camera used
    for the video stream. If no such ID exists, or if you don't pass this argument,
    the default webcam for
    your computer will be used. See <a href="#"
    onclick="open_doc('Picture.show_video_cameras_doc_id')">show_video_cameras</a>
    or click <button onclick="Picture.show_video_cameras()">show video cameras</button>
    for a list of attached cameras and their id's. <br/>
<b>callback</b> Default: <code>undefined</code>
Once the video display is up, this method is called. The default is to do nothing.

To capture a picture from a camera, you must create a video stream to
the camera and take a snapshot. This is what take_picture does.<br/>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
<b>video_id</b> Default: <code>"video_id"</code> This can be a string of
the id of a VIDEO DOM element to show the video, or the DOM element itself.
If its a string and the corresponding DOM element doesn't exist,
one is created in a new show_window.<br/>
<b>camera_id</b> Default: <code>undefined</code> If there is already
a DOM element in, or pointed to, by video_id, this argument is ignored.
Otherwise its the ID of the camera to take the picture with.<br/>
<b>callback</b> Default: <code>Picture.show_picture_of_mat</code>
Called with an argument of the OpenCV.js mat made from this snapshot.<br/>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Low Level</summary>
OpenCV.js's low level data structures are tricky, probably
due to being based on C++ and the need for speed and memory efficiency.
See all of the links on <a target="_blank"
  href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/d1/d78/tutorial_js_table_of_contents_core.html">
  OpenCV.js Core Operations</a>.
DDE's easier-to-use wrappers for them slows them down a bit, but for many uses, not
enough to matter. (The slowest code is non-working code!)
<p></p>
We've tried to design
Picture such that it is essentially compatible with OpenCV.js so you can
mix and match Picture constructs with OpenCV.js's.
<p></p>
<i>The most important of the data structures are ...</i>
<details id="cv.Scalar_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Scalar</summary>
In computer software, usually this term refers to a single number.
OpenCV uses it to mean an array of 4 numbers, usally representing a pixel's
red, green, blue, and alpha channels. In OpenCV.js you can often use<br/>
<code>[0, 55, 128, 255]</code><br/>
in place of<br/>
<code>new cv.Scalar(0, 55, 128, 255)</code>.<br/>This represents a blue-green color.
</details>

<details id="mat_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>mat</summary>
OpenCVs representation of a picture, or image. It is a 2D matrix
with some meta-data attached. There are many kinds of elements in mats,
with different number of bytes, etc. Picture concerns itself with just two.<br/>
1. A mat with a single byte for an element used for gray pictures (values 0 through
255 inclusive).<br/>
2. A mat with 4 bytes, one for each of red, green, blue, and alpha (rgba).
Alpha is transparency wherein 0 is completely transparent and 255 is opague.
Picture defaults alpha to 255.<br/>
These two mat types can get you through a lot of image processing.

<i>Low-Level Methods ...</i>
<details id="Picture.is_mat_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>is_mat</summary>
Returns true if the passed in object is a mat, otherwise false.<br/>
<i>Parameters:</i></br/>
<b>mat</b> A mat. Required.<br/>
<b>type</b> Default: <code>null</code> meaning any type of mat is ok.<br/>
Possible values:<br/>
    <code>null</code> meaning any type of mat is ok.<br/>
    <code>"gray"</code>. This function will return <code>true</code> only if mat is a gray mat.
        (Each matrix is a byte where 0 means black and 255 means white.<br/>
        <code>"color"</code> This function will return <code>true</code> only if mat is a color mat.<br/>
    <i>Examples:</i><br/>
     <code>Picture.is_mat(Picture.make_mat(), "rgba")</code> => <samp>true</samp><br/>
     <code>Picture.is_mat(42)</code> => <samp>false</samp>

    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>type</b> Default: <code>"rgba"</code> <br/>
    Possible values:<br/>
    <code>"rgba"</code> Makes a color mat.<br/>
    <code>"gray"</code> Makes a gray-scale mat. Don't use "grey".<br/>
    <b>width</b> Default: <code>320</code><br/>
    <b>height</b> Default: <code>240</code><br/>
    <b>color</b> Default: <code>[0, 0, 0, 255]</code>
    For "rgba" mats, an array of 4 numbers, one for red, green, blue, and alpha
    ranging from 0 through 255 inclusive.<br/>
     For "gray" mats, only the first
    element is used. If this is a number, say, 33, it is used to
    construct [33, 33, 33, 255] which is used in place of the number.<br/>
    <i>Examples:</i><br/>
    <code>Picture.make_mat()</code><br/>
     Makes a color initialized to all black.<p></p>
    <code>Picture.make_mat({type: "gray", color: 75} )</code><br/>
    A gray-scale mat initialized to a dark gray.<p></p>

</details> <!-- ends Low Level -->

<details class="doc_details"><summary>High Level</summary>
These methods are, for the most part, wrappers around
one or more OpenCV.js methods that take a mat or two as inputs
and return a mat or some analysis of the input mats.
<p></p>
In OpenCV.js, generally the methods must take a "dst" (destination) argument
which is a mat that is "filled in" by the method.
Picture methods allow you to NOT pass in this "dst" argument
(which Picture calls "mat_out"). If it is not passed in,
a new one of the appropriate size is automatically created.
Regardless of whether the mat is created, the mat_out is returned
by the method. It is efficient to "reuse" output mats.

<details id="Picture.mat_average_color_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>mat_average_color</summary>
Returns the average of all the pixels in the passed in mat.
Think of this as a drastic simplification of a picture, which
is sometimes all you need. You can use it to compare two
pictures for "overall color balance".<br/>
The workhorse of this method is <code>cv.mean</code>
<br/>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
<b>mat</b> Required. May be of type "rgba" or "gray".<br/>
<b>return_integer</b> Default: <code>false</code>
When  <code>false</code>, an array of 4 nuumbers is returned.
If the mat is "gray", the first number in the array will be the
average gray value of all the pixels and the other array elements
will be 0. <br/>
If the mat is "rgba", the average of each component is returned.
So for example, a picture of a forrest will likely have a higher
value for the green component than the red and blue components.
<p></p>
If return_integer is  <code>true</code> ,
and if the mat is of type "gray", the first element of the
average color array is returned, ie the average gray value for
the whole image.<br/>
If the mat is "rgba", then the red, green and blue pixel values
are averaged and that is returned.
The integer will be between 0 and 255 inclusive.<br/>
<i>Examples:</i><br/>
<code>Picture.mat_average_color(Picture.make_mat(), true)</code><br/>
    => <samp>0</samp><br/>
<code title="unEVALable">Picture.mat_average_color(mat, true) > 128</code>
is a great first cut at sensing if its day time or the lights are on.
A value closer to 1 than 0 indicates a more lighted area.<br/>
</details>

<details id="Picture.mat_to_gray_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>mat_to_gray</summary>
    Converts a color mat to a gray mat that has just one numerical value
    (0 to 255 inclusive) per pixel.<br/>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>mat_in</b> Required. Usually a color mat.
    If mat_in happens to already be a gray mat, it is returned and mat_out is not used.<br/>
    <b>mat_out</b> Default: <code>null</code> meaning that a new mat of the
    same width and height of mat_in will be created.
    Whether or not a new mat is created, a gray mat will be returned.<br/>
    <i>Example:</i><br/>
    <code>Picture.mat_to_gray(Picture.make_mat())</code><br/>
</details>

<details id="Picture.mats_diff_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>mats_diff</summary>
    Subtracts each component of each pixel in mat_in1 from the corresponding
    pixel in mat_in2, and places the absolute value of the result
    into mat_out, which is returned. The output mat will be
    of the same type as the input mat (i.e. "rgba" or "gray".)
    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>mat_in1</b> Required. mat of type "rgba" or "gray".<br/>
    <b>mat_in2</b> Required. mat of type "rgba" or "gray". Must be the same type as mat_in1.
    Which of the two input mats is mat_in1 and mat_in2 doesn't matter.<br/>
    <b>mat_out</b> Default: <code>null</code> meaning that a new mat of the
    same width, height and type of mat_in1 will be created.
    Whether or not a new mat is created, the output mat will be returned.<br/>
    <i>Example:</i><br/>
    <code>Picture.mats_diff({mat_in1: Picture.make_mat(), mat_in2: Picture.make_mat()})</code>
    <p></p>
    This method is especially useful in subtracting a background from a picture
    with the same background except that there's a foreground object,
    thus giving you a picture with a black background and just the
    pixels of the foreground. Note that because the foreground region
    will also have the background "behind it" subtracted, the
    colors of resultant image in the foreground region will not
    be the same as the forefround in the original picture,
    but they are very likely to have positive (not zero) values.
</details>

<details id="Picture.threshold_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>threshold</summary>
    The input mat can be either "rgba" or 'gray".
    The output mat will be of the same type as the input,
    but the color components of its pixels will be one of two values.
    The two values are chosen from a set of 4 values:
    0, thresh, max_value, and the original value of the pixel.
    Which 2 out of the 4 possible values and how those two
    are used, is determined by the threshold_type argument.
    This function is a wrapper around <code>cv.threshold</code>
    <br/>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>mat_in</b> Required. An "rgba" or "gray" mat.<br/>
    <b>thresh</b> Default: <code>30</code>. A number between 0 and 255 inclusive.<br/>
    <b>max_value</b> Default: <code>255</code>. A number between 0 and 255 inclusive.<br/>
    <b>threshold_type</b> Default: <code>cv.THRESH_BINARY</code>.
    Determines each output pixel's value based on the relationship
    between the input pixel's value and the thresh input.
    The output pixel values are computed like so:
    <ul>
        <li><code>cv.THRESH_BINARY</code><br/>(in > thresh) ? max_value : 0 </li>
        <li><code>cv.THRESH_BINARY_INV</code><br/>(in > thresh) ? 0 : max_value</li>
        <li><code>cv.THRESH_TRUNC</code><br/>(in > thresh) ? thresh : in</li>
        <li><code>cv.THRESH_TOZERO</code><br/>(in > thresh) ? thresh : 0</li>
        <li><code>cv.THRESH_TOZERO_INV</code><br/>(in > thresh) ? 0 : in</li>
    </ul>
    <i>Example:</i><br/>
    <pre><code>Picture.threshold({
    mat_in: Picture.make_mat(),
    thresh: 1,
    max_value: 254,
    threshold_type: cv.THRESH_BINARY_INV})
    </code></pre>
</details>
<details id="Picture.remove_noise_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>remove_noise</summary>
    The input mat can be either "rgba" or "gray".
    The output mat will be of the same type as the input,
    but it will have less detail. Small, isolated patches of a color will
    be removed.
    <br/>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>mat_in</b> Required. An "rgba" or "gray" mat.<br/>
    <b>noise_size</b> Default: <code>3</code>. A positive integer that
    is the number of pixels of the side of a square.
    That "square" is conceptually placed over the top of
    each pixel in mat_in. That pixel is replaced by the
    median value of the pixels in the surrounding square.
    The larger the square, the larger the particles of noise are
    filtered out, but the more detail lost.<br/>
    This method is a wrapper around <code>cv.medianBlur</code>
    <br/>
    <i>Example:</i><br/>
    <pre><code>Picture.remove_noise({
    mat_in: Picture.make_mat(),
    noise_size: 5})
    </code></pre>
</details>

<details id="Picture.locate_object_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>locate_object</summary>
The input mat can be either "rgba" or "gray".
The output mat will be "gray".
The returned rectangle says where an object is in the input mat.
<p></p>
The secrete to locate_object works by subtracting a background mat (mat_in2) from
a mat containing an object you want to locate (in mat_in1).
Although its cleanest if you have a "pure background" mat and a background + object
mat, you can also have two mat's that both contain the object that
has moved a slight amount. In that case, the center of the located object
will be between the center's of the objects in the two mats and the
rect contains a union of the object's points in both mats.
If the difference in the position of the object in the two input mats is slight,
this is often good enough at locating the object.<br/>
It calls, in order:
<ol><li>Picture.mats_diff</li>
    <li>Picture.mat_to_gray</li>
    <li>Picture.threshold</li>
    <li>Picture.remove_noise</li>
</ol>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
<b>mat_in1</b> Default: Required. The "foreground" mat.<br/>
<b>mat_in2</b> Default: <code>null</code>. The background mat.
If null, assume that the foreground mat is a picture of
an object surrounded by black.<br/>
<b>mat_out</b> Default: <code>null</code>.
If null, a new mat is created for the output. It will be of type "gray".<br/>
<b>threshold</b> Default: <code>30</code>. An integer between 0 and 255 inclusive.
Pixel values below or equal to the threshold will be converted to black.
Those above it will be converted to white. Those white pixels will
depict the object you want to locate.<br/>
<b>noise_size</b> Default: <code>3</code>. See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Picture.remove_noise_doc_id')">noise_size</a>.<br/>
<b>out_format</b> Default: <code>"min_area_rect"</code>.
Determines what kind of rectangle is computed to locate the object.<br/>
<i style="color:darkorange;">The details of the object returned by locate_object depend on
this argument but are in flux and will likely change in future releases.</i><br/>
<code>"rect"</code> returns a rect that is oriented with the pixel grid
and represented as an array of x, y, width and height.<br/>
<code>"min_area_rect"</code> causes the returned rect to be a rotated rect of the
minimum area to enclose the points of the object. It often has
a smaller area to enclose the object points than "rect". Please inspect the returned
value to see its fields. A work in progress!<br/>
<code>"hull"</code> does not return a rectangle at all but rather
a set of points that describe lines that surround the object.
Whereas a rectangle will have, effectively just 4 such points,
with 4 lines, where lines 1 and 3 are parallel and lines 2 and 4
are parallel, "hull" may have many lines, none of which may be parallel.
The described hull is convex, meaning that the angle between two adjacent
lines is less than 180 degrees from the standpoint of the center of the object.
"hull" gives the most accurate shape of the object, (hugs the object tightest)
 but is more complex to work with.<br/>
 If there are no points for a located object, <code>null</code> will be returned
 from locate_object.
<b>avg_center</b> Default: <code>true</code>.
Only relevent for "min_area_rect". If this is <code>false</code>,
 the center_x and center_y properties of the returned object
 represent the center of the rectangle locating the object.
 If it is <code>true</code>, center_x and center_y represent
 a kind of "center of mass", wherein for all the pixels of the
 object (white), center_x is the average of all the x locations,
 and center_y is the average of all the y locations.
 If the recognized object's pixels solidly fill in the rectangle
 with no external points, the rect center and  average center are
 the same. But often the recognized object's pixels are more "clumped"
 with lots of blackspace in between clumps.
 If there happen to be a few "noise points" not part of the object,
 these are effectively averaged out by the more numerous in-object points.
 Thus the noise points are less damaging to the accuracy of the real
 center of the object.<br/>
<b>show</b> Default: <code>true</code>.
After location of the object, display a show_window containing the
black and white mat of the white points of the located object
with the rect and center_x and center_y shown as an overlay in red.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<pre><code>Picture.locate_object({
    mat_in1: Picture.make_mat(),
    mat_in2: Picture.make_mat(),
    mat_out:null,
    threshold:30,
    noise_size:3,
    out_format:"min_area_rect", //or "rect", "hull"

<details id="Picture.detect_blobs_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>detect_blobs</summary>
In machine vision, a blob is a small, dense set of connected pixels of similar color
often forming a simple geometric shape like a filled in circle or rectangle.
Many pictures will contain several to numerous blobs. By identifying the
size, shape and location of such blobs, you can locate particular "features"
within an image, or even use the pattern of such blobs to identify
complex objects.
<p></p>
Picture.detect_blobs is a complex wrapper for the complex <code>cv.SimpleBlobDetector</code>.
It returns an array of objects, one for each blob.<br/>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>mat_in</b> Default: Required. The mat to detect the blobs in. It can be of type "rgba" or "gray".<br/>
    <b>mat_out</b> Default: <code>null</code>. A mat to use in internal processing. If null,
    one is created. <br/>
    <b>white_level</b> Default: <code>128</code>. An integer from 0 through 255 inclusive.
    This converts the mat_in to a black and white image wherein the all the values
    in mat_in that are between 0 and 128 are converted to 255 (white) and
     the values above white_level are converted to 0 (black).
     Thus it inverts the colors. mat_in light areas are converted to black.
     mat_in dark areas are converted to white.
     Our blobs are formed by the lighter areas in mat_in.
     white_level is used as the "lowerb" in <code>cv.inRange</code> to implement this
     stage of processing mat_in.<br/>
    <b>show_picture</b> Default: <code>true</code>. If true, a picture is shown with
    the detected blobs circled in a color. Useful for debugging and tweaking
    other parameters.<br/>
    <b>show_keypoints</b> Default: <code>true</code>. Shows a window of the detected blobs
    and their properties. Useful for debugging.<br/>
    <b>sort_by</b> Default: <code>"max_size_first"</code>.  How to order the array of returned
    blob objects. <br/>
    Possible values:<br/>
    <code>"max_size_first"</code> Orders the blobs by largest first.<br/>
    <code>"size"</code> Orders the blobs by smallest first.<br/>
    <code>"max_x_first"</code> Orders the blobs by right-most first.<br/>
    <code>"x"</code> Orders the blobs by left-most first.<br/>
    <code>"max_y_first"</code> Orders the blobs by bottom-most first.<br/>
    <code>"y"</code> Orders the blobs by top-most first.<br/>

    <b>opencv_result_format</b> Default: <code>false</code>. If false, the result array
    has objects with properties:
    <ul>
        <li><b>x</b> The number of pixels from the left of the picture of the blob.</li>
        <li><b>y</b> The number of pixels from the top of the picture of the blob</li>
        <li><b>size</b> A rough measure of the size or diameter of the blob.</li>
    </ul>
    If <code>true</code>, the result objects are OpenCV's format for keypoints that's more confusing.
    <p></p>
     <i>The rest of these parameters are passed to cv.SimpleBlobDetector.
     See OpenCV for documentation.</i><br/>
     <b>thresholdStep</b> Default: <code>10</code>.<br/>
     <b>minThreshold</b> Default: <code>50</code>.<br/>
     <b>maxThreshold</b> Default: <code>220</code>.<br/>

     <b>minRepeatability</b> Default: <code>2</code>.<br/>
     <b>minDistBetweenBlobs</b> Default: <code>10</code>.<br/>

     <b>filterByColor</b> Default: <code>true</code>. Use false to not filter by color<br/>
     <b>blobColor</b> Default: <code>0</code>.  Use 0 to select darker blobs, 255for lighter blobs<br/>

     <b>filterByArea</b> Default: <code>true</code>. Use true to filter by area, false to not filter by area.<br/>
     <b>minArea</b> Default: <code>40</code>.   Area is in pixels.<br/>
     <b>maxArea</b> Default: <code>700</code>. A non negative integer. <br/>
     <b>filterByCircularity</b> Default: <code>true</code>.<br/>
     <b>minCircularity</b> Default:  <code>0</code>.  0 means the least circular shape. <br/>
     <b>maxCircularity</b> Default: <code>1</code>. 1 means a perfect circle. 0.785 is a square. <br/>

     <b>filterByInertia</b> Default:  <code>false</code>.<br/>
     <b>minInertiaRatio</b> Default:  <code>0.1</code>.  0 means a line. 1 means a circle<br/>
     <b>maxInertiaRatio</b> Default:  <code>1</code>.   0 to 1. An ellipse is recognized by a value between 0 and 1.<br/>

     <b>filterByConvexity</b> Default: <code>false</code>.<br/>
     <b>minConvexity</b> Default: <code>0.95</code>.  0 to 1.  0 means lots of concave parts of the perimeter (like a star)<br/>
     <b>maxConvexity</b> Default:  <code>1</code>. <br/>
     <i>Example:</i><br/>
     <pre><code>Picture.init()
Picture.show_picture() //uses a picture of a PC board.
//Wait for picture to show
var mat1 = cv.imread(canvas_id)
Picture.detect_blobs({mat_in: mat1, sort_by:"y"})

<details id="make_classifier" class="doc_details"><summary>make_classifier</summary>
OpenCV.js has a way to detect objects based on a compilation of features of
numerous pictures of the object you want to detect.
A compilation of these features is stored in an xml file.
<i>make_classifier</i> makes and returns an object that encapsulates such xml files
for use by <code>Picture.classifier_detect</code>.<br/>
<i>make_classifier</i> is a wrapper for OpenCV's <code>new cv.CascadeClassifier()</code><br/>
<i>Parameter:</i><br/>
<b>path</b> Default: <code>null</code> which uses the file
at the path: <code>__dirname + "/vision/lbpcascade_frontalface.xml"</code>,
stored inside of DDE.
This is a small, simple face recognition classifier.
Beware, it works poorly on faces with glasses on.
A larger, 1Mbyte face classifier is available at:<br/>
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencv/opencv/master/data/lbpcascades/lbpcascade_frontalface.xml<br/>
More xml files are under: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data
<p></p>
You can't use a url for the path argument. You must first download
the file to your local machine. The simplest place to put it is in your
<code>dde_apps_folder</code> folder because then you can just use the file's name and extension
(without a folder name) as the path argument to <i>make_classifier</i>.
<br/>
<i>Examples:</i><br/>
<code>Picture.init()</code><br/>
<code>Picture.make_classifier()</code><br/>
<code>Picture.make_classifier(__dirname + "/vision/lbpcascade_frontalface.xml")</code><br/>
Both these examples use the same xml file because the file
given in the 2nd example is the default file.
<p></p>
DDE does not yet document how to make such xml files from a set of pictures in an object.
This is not easy, but can be done with OpenCV.

<details id="classifier_detect" class="doc_details"><summary>classifier_detect</summary>
Finds objects specified by a classifier in a given picture.
The returned value is an array of rectangles where the recognized objects
appear in the given picture.<br/>
It is a wrapper for OpenCV's <code title="unEVALable psuedocode">classifier.detectMultiScale()</code><br/>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>classifier</b> Required. A classifier object made with
        <code>Picture.make_classifier()</code><br/>
    <b>mat_in</b> Required. A color or gray mat. <br/>
    <b>scale_factor</b> Default: <code>1.1</code>
        How much the image size is reduced at each image scale.<br/>
    <b>min_neighbors</b> Default: <code>3</code> An integer. A lower value
        makes the detection of an object more likely. A higher value
        is more discerning when detecting an object.<br/>
    <b>min_size</b>  Default: <code>new cv.Size()</code> The minimum size
        of an object to be detected.<br/>
        Example: <code> new cv.Size(50, 50)</code><br/>
    <b>max_size</b>  Default: <code>new cv.Size()</code> <br/>
        Example: <code> new cv.Size(200, 100)</code><br/>
    <b>show</b> Default: <code>true</code>. If true,
        a show_window pops up showing mat_in with red rectangles around
        each detected object.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<pre><code title="not in test suite"> Picture.init()
 var my_classifier = Picture.make_classifier()
 var mat1
 Picture.take_picture({callback: function(mat) { mat1 = mat }} )
 //pause to allow picture to be taken.
 Picture.classifier_detect({classifier: my_classifier,
                            mat_in: mat1})
    </code></pre>
In the above example, the first line creates the cloassifier object
that is used as an arugment in the last line.
The 2nd line declares a global variable which
is set in the callback of the 3rd line.
This global variable is used in the last line as the mat_in
to look in for the object being detected.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Similarity</summary>
Understanding how similar two pictures are can help classify pictures into categories,
tell you if the scene is as expected and a variety of other useful machine vision tasks.
<p></p>
Similarity has many potential dimensions. The Picture class contains
some methods for telling you how similar two mats are along different dimentions.
They all take 2 mats as inputs and return a floating point number between
0 and 1, with 0 meaning very dissimilar and 1 meaning very similar.

<details id="Picture.mats_similarity_by_average_color_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>mats_similarity_by_average_color</summary>
    This method gets the average color of the two input methods,
    subtracts them, takes the absolute value of that,
    divides it by 255 and subtracts it from 1.
    Its a crude similarity wherein what counts is the overall color balance
    of a picture, not <i>where</i> those colors are in the picture.
    Thus its possible that a picture of white clouds and a picture of a white wedding dress
    would be very similar. But different camera angles or lighting on those two subjects
    might have very different similarities.<br/>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>mat_in1</b> Required. mat of type "rgba" or "gray".<br/>
    <b>mat_in2</b> Required. mat of type "rgba" or "gray". in1 and in2
    needn't be the same type, nor even the same width and height.
    Which of the two input mats is mat_in1 and mat_in2 doesn't matter.<br/>
    <i>Example:</i><br/>
    <pre><code>Picture.mats_similarity_by_average_color({
    mat_in1: Picture.make_mat(),
    mat_in2: Picture.make_mat()})
    </code></pre>
    => <samp>1</samp>
    This method is less discerning than Picture.mats_similarity_by_color.
</details>

<details id="Picture.mats_similarity_by_color_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>mats_similarity_by_color</summary>
    Uses Picture.mats_diff to substract one mat from another, then
    gets the average value of that mat to return a number
    between 0 and 1. The result is adjusted such that
    0 means the pictures are very different, and 1 means they are very similar.
    The two input mats can both be "rgba" or both be "gray".
    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>mat_in1</b> Required. mat of type "rgba" or "gray".<br/>
    <b>mat_in2</b> Required. mat of type "rgba" or "gray". Must be the same type as mat_in1.
    Which of the two input mats is mat_in1 and mat_in2 doesn't matter.<br/>
    <b>mat_out</b> Default: <code>null</code> meaning that a new mat of the
    same width, height and type of mat_in1 will be created to store the
    difference of the two input mats temporarily.<br/>
    <i>Example:</i><br/>
    <pre><code>Picture.mats_similarity_by_color({
    mat_in1: Picture.make_mat(),
    mat_in2: Picture.make_mat()})
    </code></pre>
    => <samp>1</samp>
    This method is a cheap way to tell how similar two mats are.
</details> <!-- mats_similarity_by_color -->

<details id="Picture.mats_similarity_by_detect_blobs_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>mats_similarity_by_detect_blobs</summary>
<code>Picture.detect_blobs</code> is called on each of the two input mats. Then the arrays of blob objects
are compared for similarity.<br>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
<b>mat_in1</b> Default: Required. Can be of type "rgba" or "gray".<br/>
<b>mat_in2</b> Default: Required. Can be of type "rgba" or "gray".<br/>
<b>mat_out</b> Default: <code>null</code>. A mat used for internal processing. It will be automatically created if not passed in.<br/>
<b>point_count</b> Default: <code>10</code>. The number of blobs to consider from
each input mat. You may want to set this number low to avoid "noise" blobs.<br/>
If the number of blobs found in one or more input mats is
less than this number, then only that number are considered.
When the number of blobs in one or two input mats is less than point_count,
and the blob counts from each mat are not equal, that will boost the dissimilarity
of the input mats.<br/>
<b>sort_by</b> Default: <code>"max_size_first"</code> The array of blobs found
in each input mat are sorted by this. As blobs are compared,
the first blob from mat_in1 is compared to the first blob in mat_in2,
then the second blob from each input mat is compared, etc. on up
to point_count blobs. Thus the value of sort_by is crucial for determining
the kind of similarity you will get.
See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Picture.detect_blob_doc_id')">Picture.detect_blob</a>
for sort_by details.
<p></p> Each blob comparison contributes a score to the similarity returned value.
Each attribute within each blob object is compared with its counterpart in
the other input mat. So for instance,
mat_in1's first blob, x attribute is compared with
mat_in2's first blob, x attribute. If they happen to be the same,
that comparison indicates maximum similarity. If they differ by a bit,
say 105 and 107 then they are considered to be very similar.
If they differ by a lot, say 2 to 103, they are considered to be quite dissimilar.
The comparison of numbers is not a simple difference. For instance,
the similarity between 1 and 2 is much less than the similarity of 67 and 68
even through their strict difference in both cases is just 1.
<p></p>
mats_similarity_by_detect_blobs takes all the arguments of
<a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Picture.detect_blobs_doc_id')">Picture.detect_blob</a>
except that Picture.detect_blobs' <i>mat_in</i> is replaced by
Picture.mats_similarity_by_detect_blob's <i>mat_in1</i> and <i>mat_in2</i>.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<pre><code>Picture.mats_similarity_by_detect_blobs(
    {mat_in1: Picture.make_mat(),
     mat_in2: Picture.make_mat()})
     </code></pre> =>
<samp>0.5</samp><br/>
Because we are passing in mats where no blobs are detected, we can't really say much about
their similarity. so <code>0.5</code> is returned.

<details id="music_with_midi_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Music with MIDI</summary>
DDE facilitates using MIDI to play and receive MIDI notes.
There are higher level "phrase processors" that make creating scores
relatively easy. <a href="#" onclick="open_doc(music_article_doc_id, event)">
The Language of Music</a> describes DDE's approach to music in broad themes.<br/>
For a video presentation of many of these ideas, watch
<a href="http://hdrobotic.com/webinar#making_music" target="blank">Making Music</a>
<p></p>
The fundamental class is Note, that represents a musical note, including
its duration (and, effectively, its ending time).
Phrase is a class who's instances hold sequences of Note instances.
Notes and Phrases share nearly the same instances variables and methods.
<p></p>
In order to play notes, we need to interface to MIDI.
<details id="MIDI_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>MIDI</summary>
MIDI is an acroymn for Musical Instrument Digital Interface.
Its a decades old standard for how to control sounds using
electronics, that has been applied to lighting and other
remote control situations.
<p></p>
DDE uses the <a href="https://github.com/cotejp/webmidi" target="_blank">WebMidi</a> Javascript library to connect
DDE and MIDI. DDE layers software on top of WebMidi to form higher level
msuic data structures and methods including integrating them into Jobs
for making things. One of the things you can make in DDE is music.
<p></p>
DDE can be used to both create MIDI events and receive them.
To hear a MIDI note that DDE creates, you must connect a synthesizer to
the computer running DDE. Numerous hardware synthesizers are avaiable
starting at about $100. You can also use free or commercial "software synthesizers".
</details>
<details  class="doc_details"><summary>Synthesizers</summary>
One such software synthesizer is in Apple's GarageBand,
which is now free for Mac and Windows.
On modern Macs, in your Applications folder
you should see GarageBand.app which comes comes with the OS.
Double click on it. This will cause its full contents
to download. I takes 15 minutes or so because GarageBand uses
mmany digitally recorded instruments to create natural sounds.
(Other synthesizers uses alorithms to create sounds which are typcally
much smaller, have lots of "variations" but none of them sound
like acoustic instruments.)
Once GarageBand downloading complete, launch it by double clicking the file,
if it isn' already up.
<p></p>
On WindowsOS, see https://garagebandforwindowspc.org/ for the more
complex installation on Windows.
Another approach to getting good-sounding synthesized sounds on Windows is
<a target="_blank" href="http://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth">
VirtualMIDISynth</a> with some sampled instrument
"sound fonts" such as
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.synthfont.com/soundfonts.html">FluidR3 GM Bank</a>
<p></p>
With GB launched, double click on "Keyboard Collection".
You can leave the default instrument, or
select another one from the left side of GB.
Then choose GB menu bar/Window/Show Keyboard.  The image of a piano
keyboard should appear. Click on any note. If you don't hear
a sound, verify that the unlabeled
horizontal slider in the upper right of GB is slid to the right for
a non-zreo volume.
(Note Apple has followed its standard user interface guidelines
here, spending effort to make the slider look pretty
but difficult to figure out what it actually means.)
Also check that the volume control on your computer is up.

<b id="Midi.init_doc_id">Midi.init</b> initializes Midi.
This is automatically done when you attempt to play a note
and Midi has not been inited, but there will be a slight delay in that case.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<code title="not in TestSuite">Midi.init()</code><br/>

If Midi has previously been inited, this calls <code>Midi.all_notes_off</code>.
This can also be called by choosing Insert menu/Sound/Midi.init().<br/>
<i>Parameters:</i> None.
<p></p>
<b id="Midi.all_notes_off_doc_id">Midi.all_notes_off</b> Turns off
all curently on notes on all channels. Does not work when using
GarageBand for a synthesizer.<br/>
<i>Parameters:</i> None.
<p></p>
<b id="Midi.describe_midi_event_doc_id">Midi.describe_midi_event</b>
used as a diagnostic function to print out of of the properties of
a MIDI event.
<i>Example:</i>
<code title="not in TestSuite">WebMidi.inputs[1].addListener('noteon',  "all", Midi.describe_midi_event)</code>
<p></p>

In DDE, Eval <code title="not in TestSuite">Midi.init()</code>.<br/>
Now eval <code title="not in TestSuite">new Note("C").start()</code><br/>
OR select <code>new Note("C")</code><br/>
and click <button>Eval&Start</button><br/>
Often the first note or two will get lost so do it a few times
and you should hear Middle C played on the instrument you have
selected in GarageBand. <br/>
<code>Midi.init</code> can also be called by choosing
Insert menu/Sound/Midi.init().
<p></p>
If you don't hear a sound, check the MIDI connections in
GarageBand: menu bar/GarageBand/Preferences.<br/>
Select "Audio/Midi"<br/>
In the bottom of the dialog you should see
"Midi Status: X MIDI inputs detected."<br/>
(if X == 0, try clicking the "Reset Midi Drivers" button.)
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Connecting MIDI Apps</summary>
DDE and GarageBand (or another synthesizer) are both MIDI Apps.
To have DDE send a MIDI event to a synthesizer, you have to
connect those apps via the operating system using a
"Virtual Port".
This is tricky.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Note</summary>
Note is the fundamental class for creating music. It contains
a number of instance variables to hold the properties of a note,
and a bunch of methods to manipulate Notes.
    <details class="doc_details"><summary>Note's Instance Variables</summary>
        <ul><li><b>time</b> A number. The starting time of the note. This is in beats.
             <i>time</i> defaults to <code>0</code>. seconds_per_beat defaults to
             1, but is usually supplied by the Phrase that contains the note.
             If the Note isn't being played from a phrase, the default seconds_per_beat of 1 will
             be used.
        </li>
        <li><b>dur</b> A positive number indicating note duration. The amount of time from <i>time</i> that the note ends,
             in beats
        </li>
        <li><b>pitch</b> Default <code>60</code>. An integer between 0 and 127.
             This determines the frequency of the note. 60 is Middle C, 72 is the C an octave higher.
             <p></p>
             When you are creating notes, you can use the more friendly notation of "C" for
             Middle C, "C5" for C an octave higher, "C#" for C sharp, "Db" for D flat, etc.<br/>
             "R" is used to mean "rest", useful when you're making a sequnce of
             notes in a phrase.
             Beware: Sometimes MIDIcians use the term "note" to mean pitch.
             Beware: Middle C can be refered to as "C4" (as is a somewhat
             standard practice in music) but it produces
             the MIDI pitch of 60. It would have been more logical to have
             "C4" map to 48 since that's 4 times 12 (the number of pitches in an octave).
             MIDI's designers were not logical.
        </li>
        <li><b>velocity</b> Default <code>0.5</code>. MIDI's misspelling for "volume".
            The term comes from
            the harder you hit a piano key, the faster it goes, making a louder sound.
            A number between 0 and 1. This results in an actual MIDI velocity
            of an integer between 0 and 127. WebMidi wisely chose to make this
            a float between 0 and 1 by default (which DDE follows)
            as volumes are often multiplied
            to increase or decrease them. 0 to 1 is more convenient for that.
        </li>
        <li><b>channel</b> Default 1. An integer between 1 and 16 inclusive,
            determining the MIDI channel of the note. Think of this as the instrument
            to play the note on, though beware. Channel can be remapped by syntheizer software
            to play different instruments.
        </li>
        </ul>
    </details> <!-- end Note Instance Vars -->
    <details class="doc_details">
      <summary>Making Notes with <code title="unEVALable">new</code></summary>
      DDE provides 2 different ways to make notes. The hard, comprehensive way
      is to use JS literal object notation:
      <pre><code>new Note({time:     0,
          dur: 1,
          pitch:    60,
          velocity: 0.5,
          channel:  1})
      </code></pre>
      The above values are the defaults. Leave a property out and you
      get its default value.
      <p></p>
      The easy way is to use a string with
      <ol><li>the (optional) duration first (default 1),
            <li>followed by the pitch class (C, D, E, F, G, A, B)</li>
            <li>that may include a trailing accidental (# or b)</li>
            <li>and ending with an optional octave integer (-2 to 8 inclusive)
            The "C"s in each octave are:
            Octave -2 is MIDI pitch 0,<br/> -1 is 0,<br/>
            0 is 12,<br/> 1 is 24,<br/>  2 is 36,<br/>
            3 is 48,<br/> 4 is 60 (Middle C),<br/>
             5 is 71,<br/> 6 is 84,<br/> 7 is 96,<br/> 8 is 108<br/>
             9 is 120.
           </li>
      </ol>
            <i>Examples:</i><br/>
            <code>"C"</code> and <code>"1C4"</code>
            are both a one beat long Middle C.<br/>
        <code>"0.5C#5"</code> is an eighth note C sharp an octave and a half-step above Middle C.<br/>
        <code>"0.5Db5"</code> is the same.<br/>
            For creating an actual note the easy way use:<br/>
            <code>new Note("0.5C#5")</code><br/>
            This is equivalent to the hard way:
             <pre><code>new Note({dur: 0.5, pitch: 73})</code></pre>
            or you can use the string technique for pitch:
            <pre><code>new Note({dur: 0.5, pitch: "C#5"})</code></pre>
      You may place a Note directly on the do_list of a Job.
      When that "instruction" is run, it will call the Note's start method
      to play it, and delay running the next instruction until the note is done.

        <details id="Note.arpeggio_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>arpeggio</summary>
        An arpeggio is several small, short notes played in rapid succession.
        Often the pitches are those of a chord played from lowest to highest.
        The arpeggio method on a note returns a phrase based in the intervals
        and durations it is passed.<p></p>
        <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
        <b>interval_or_array</b> If this is one number, it represents an interval from the
        incoming pitch to be output. If this is an array, it represents several intervals,
        each of which will be made into a new pitch (and note). Usually this is an array
        since a 1 note arpegio is easier to accomplish in other ways.<br/>
        <b>key</b> Default: <code>"chromatic"</code>. If "chromatic", interpret the
        intervals as half-steps to add to the incoming pitch to form the new pitch(es).
        If this is a pitch class, ie "C", "D#", etc. interpret the intervals as diatonic,
        with 1 meaning the "unison".<br/>
        <b>dur_or_array</b> Default: <code>null</code>
        <ul><li>If this is a number,
        it is the duration of the note(s) produced by this arpeggio.</li>
        <li>If it is an array,
        it is the duration of the notes corresponding to the intervals in interval_or_array,
        which should be an array of the same length.</li>
        <li>If it is null, and there is just an integer for interval_or_array,
        the dur of the output note will be the same as its original dur.
        But if interval_or_array is an array, then the dur of each note
        in the arpeggio will be the original dur divided by the number
        of notes specified in interval_or_array. For instance,
        if the original note has a dur of 0.5 and the
        interval_or_array has 2 intervals and the dur is null.
        each note in the output arpeggio will have a dur of<br/>
        <code>0.5 / 2</code> => <samp>0.25</samp>.
        </li></ul>
        <i>Example:</i><br/>
        <code>new Note("C").arpeggio([1, 3, 5], "C")</code>=><br/>
        <samp>new Phrase("1/3C 1/3E 1/3G")</samp>
        </details>

        <details id="Note.copy_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>copy</summary>
           Copies the note. Most note processors copy their note.<br/>

            <i>Example:</i><br/>
            <pre><code>new Note("E").concat(
    new Note("D"),
    new Note("C"))
    </code></pre><br>
         Returns a phrase that's a melody, with the last note starting on beat 2 and
         ending on beat 3.<br/>
         Equivalent to<br/><code>new Phrase("E D C")</code>
        </details>
        <details id="Note.filter_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>filter</summary>
            This returns either null or the note passed in as "this".
            If the filter_in arg is true (the default), then
            if this is between min_note and max_note in all
            the properties supplied in min_note and max_note, then
            this is returned. Otherwise null is returned.
            <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
            <b>min_note</b> Default <code>{}</code>. A note or a literal object
            with possible properties of channel, dur, pitch, time, velocity.
            The note will possibly be "filtered in" if the corresponding
            values in this are more than or equal to the values in min_note.
            Pitch may be an integer or a "named" pitch ("C", "D#4", etc.)
            <br/>
            <b>max_note</b> Default <code title="unEVALable">min_note</code>. A note or a literal object
            with possible properties of channel, dur, pitch, time, velocity.
            The note will possibly be "filtered in" if the corresponding
            values in this are less than the values in min_note.
            Pitch may be an integer or a "named" pitch ("C", "D#4", etc.)
            <br/>
            <b>max_is_inclusive</b> Default <code>true</code>. A boolean.
            If the corresponding values of this and max_note are equal,
            then if max_is_inclusive is true, then this is returned.
            Otherwise null is returned.
            <br/>
            <b>filter_in</b> Default: <code>true</code> A boolean.
            If true, the above descriptions of the returned value are correct.
            If false, then return this only when the note is "filtered out" by
            the above. In other words, for two calls to filter,
            if we keep all the parameters the same
            except for filter_in, then one of those two calls will return this,
            and the other will return null.
            <br/>
            <i>Examples:</i><br/>
            <code>new Note("C").filter({pitch: "B2"}, {pitch: "D"})</code> <br/>
            returns the note because "C" is between "B2" and "D".<br/>
            <code>new Note("C").filter({pitch: "D"}, {pitch: "F"})</code> <br/>
            returns null because "C" is not between "D" and "F".<br/>
            <code>new Note("C").filter({pitch: 60, velocity: 0.25}, {pitch: 60, velocity: 0.75})</code><br/>
            returns this because the pitch for this, min_note & max_note is 60 <i>and</i>
            because the velocity of this (0.5) is between 0.25 and 0.75.
            <p></p>
            You may include any combination of the 5 properties of a note.
            You do not have to include the same properties in min_note and max_note.
            Unincluded properties when filter_in is true do not filter-out the note.
            <p></p>
            <b>Rests</b><br/>
            If min_note's pitch is a rest, then max_note's pitch is not considered.
            If this' pitch is also a rest, the note is "filtered in", but
            if this's pitch is not a rest, it is filtered out.
            If this's pitch is a rest and min_note's pitch is not a rest.
            the note is filtered in. (unless of course, filter_in is false,
            in which case it is filtered out).

            <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
            <b>repetitions</b> Default: <code>2</code><br/>
            0 means return an empty phrase with no notes.<br/>

        </details>
        <details id="Note.transpose_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>transpose</summary>
        Increments the pitch by an interval or possibly multiple intervals to make
        a chord.<br/>
        <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
        <b>interval_or_array</b> Add this value to the original pitch. Can be negative
        or positive. If an array, create a note for each interval in the array
        and return a phrase. The number (or numbers in the array) are usually
        whole numbers but can be mixed numbers with a 0.5 fractional part.
        These <i>may</i> yeild out-of-key pitches. See below.
        <br/>
            <b>key</b> Default: "chromatic". If "chromatic", treats each interval as
            half_steps and directly adds them to the pitch. If a pitch class
            ("C", "C#", "D", "D#", "E", "F", "F#", "G", "G#", "A", "A#", "B",
            or the flat equivlents, ie "Db"),
            considers the intervals to be
            "diatonic". 1 is unison (no change from original pitch). 2 is a 2nd, either
            major or minor to keep the new pitch within the key specified. Same for a
            third, forth, fifth, etc. If the interval ends in .5, ie 3.5, then
            a half-step is added to the whole interval which is, in this case, "3".
            <p></p>
            Observe that "chromatic" is zero based, (as is JavaScript for array indexing),
            whereas the diatonic transpose is
            one based, as is convention music notation.
            Using a diatonic key, any value between -1 and +1 is
            the "unison" interval, ie no change.
            <p></p>
            The result might
            or might not be within the given key depending on the whole number of the interval.
            For instance, in the key of "C", an interval of 3.5 yields an "F', ie the
            same as an interval of 4 and in the given key.
            However 4.5 yields F#, out of the key.
            <i>Examples:</i><br/>
            <code>new Note("D4").transpose(1)</code><br/>=> <samp>new Note("D#4")</samp><br/>
            <code>new Note("D4").transpose(1, "C")</code><br/>=> <samp>new Note("D4")</samp><br/>
            <code>new Note("D4").transpose(2, "C")</code><br/>=> <samp>new Note("E4")</samp><br/>
            <code>new Note("D4").transpose(3, "C")</code><br/>=> <samp>new Note("F4")</samp><br/>
            Using a negative number in the <code>"chromatic"</code> key, just subtracts
            that number from the pitch to transpose it. Using a negative number for
            a diatonic key also "subtracts" it, but is more compelex.
            A negative interval does NOT mean
            a "minor second interval". It means go down 1 "scale degree".
            Thus In the key of "C", starting with a pitch of "C4", if we have -2,
            it transposes "C" to "B3". -3 transposes to "A3".

            <p></p>
            <i>Examples:</i><br/>
            <code>new Note("D4").transpose(0, "C")</code> <br/>=> <samp>new Note("D4")</samp><br/>
            <code>new Note("D4").transpose(-1, "C")</code><br/>=> <samp>new Note("D4")</samp><br/>
            <code>new Note("D4").transpose(-2, "C")</code><br/>=> <samp>new Note("C4")</samp><br/>

            The discrepancy between one-based and zero-based
            is not just an inconsistency in DDE, its a descrepancy in the English
            designators for items in a list and math. If the first item in a list was
            called "zeroth" instead of "first", that would fix the problem. I suspect
            the concept and term of "first" occured before the concept of zero. Such "off by one"
            issues account for an astoundingly high percentage of bugs in programs, so
            be on the lookout for them.<br/>
            <code>new Note("D4").transpose([1, 3, 5], "C")</code><br/>
            => <samp>new Phrase("D4F4A4")</samp><br/>
            <i>A D minor triad (chord), all of whose pitches are in the designated key of C.</i>
            <p></p>
            Diatonic intervals are normally whole numbers. When they are, transposing
            an in-key pitch using an integer interval will yeild another in-key pitch.
            However, you can also use intervals such as 1.5, 2.5, etc.
            These use the whole number to transpose as above, then add a half step to
            the resulting pitch. That might or might not end up with an in-key pitch
            depending on the original pitch.
            <p></p>
            Negative mixed-number intervals such as -1.5 and -2.5 are also allowed.
            These use the integer component to find a new pitch then decrease the pitch
            by a half-step to complete the transpose.<br/>
            <i>Example:</i> transposing "C" in the key of "C" by 1.5 yields "C#".
            The 1 is used for "unison" transpose, i.e. no change, and the 0.5 is
            used to go one half step more, giving us an out-of-key pitch.<br/>
            <i>Examples:</i><br/>
            <code>new Note("C").transpose([1, 3, 5, 7], "C")</code><br/>
            => <samp>new Phrase("CEGB")</samp> i.e. a C Major 7 chord.<br/>
            <code>new Note("C").transpose([1, 2.5, 5, 6.5], "C")</code><br/>
            => <samp>new Phrase("CEbGBb")</samp> i.e. a C Minor 7 chord.<br/>

        <ul><li><b>notes</b> An array of instances of Note. May be empty.</li>
            <li><b>time</b> A number. The starting time of the note. This is in beats.
            <i>time</i> defaults to <code>0</code>. The start time in beats of the
            first note when using a string argument to <code>new Phrase()</code>.
            </li>
            <li><b>dur</b> A positive number indicating the phrase duration. The amount of time from <i>0</i> that the phrase ends,
                in beats. Defaults to the ending tome of the last note in the phrase or 0 if no
                notes in the phrase. dur repressents the "logical duration of the phrase from time 0 to the end of the phrase.
                This is often <i>not</i> the duration from the start time of the first note to the
                end time of the last note. For instance a phrase might have some negative time "pick-up" notes,
                and have the last note end before or after the logical end. dur is used for concat in
                knowing when the start time of the 2nd through nth phrases will be.
                Thus phrase durs are often 4 or 8 beats even though the actual duration of the
                notes in the phrase are longer or shorter.
            </li>
            <li><b>velocity</b> Default <code>0.5</code>.
                The initial velocity of all the notes in the phrase.
                Velocity is MIDI's misspelling for "volume". (Tech-musicians often fail English class.)
                The term comes from
                the harder you hit a piano key, the faster it goes, making a louder sound.
                A number between 0 and 1. This results in an actual MIDI velocity
                of an integer between 0 and 127. WebMidi wisely chose to make this
                a float between 0 and 1 by default (which DDE follows)
                as volumes are often multiplied
                to increase or decrease them. 0 to 1 is more convenient for that.
            </li>
            <li><b>channel</b> Default <code>1</code>. An integer between 1 and 16 inclusive,
                determining the MIDI channel of the note. Think of this as the instrument
                to play the note on, though beware. Channel can be remapped by syntheizer software
                to play different instruments.

        <summary>Making Phrases with <code title="unEVALable">new</code></summary>
        DDE provides 2 different ways to make a phrase. The hard, comprehensive way
        is to use JS literal object notation to create each note for the notes instance
        variable like so:
        <pre><code>
new Phrase({notes: [new Note({time: 0, dur: 1, pitch: 60, velocity: 0.25, channel:  1}),
                    new Note({time: 3, dur: 1, pitch: 61, velocity: 0.75, channel:  2})
            ]})
      </code></pre>
        This gives us lots of flexibility. Notice that the 2nd note starts a whole beat after
        the first note ends. This flexibility, explicitness and ease of programming
        comes at the cost of verbosity. We can use a concise language to
        describe all but the channel and velocity attributes with:<br/>
        <code>new Phrase("C R C#")</code><br/> The R stands for "rest" giving us a
        start time for the 2nd note of 3 (beats).
        <p></p>
        The easier way uses strings with notes that are separated from other notes by a space.
        See the documentation on making Notes for details.
        <p></p>
        <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
        <b>time</b> Default <code>0</code>. A number. time in beats that the first note will have
            when the "notes" parameter is a string.<br/>
        <b>seconds_per_beat</b> Default: <code>1</code>. A non-negative number. The duration in seconds of a beat.
         The default corrsponds to 60 beats per minute. A typical value for modern music is
         <code>0.5</code><br/>
         <b>dur</b> Default: <code>null</code> meaning the ending time of the last note in the phrase.
         dur representes the "logical duration of the phrase from time 0 to the end of the phrase.
         This is often <i>not</i> the duration from the start time of the first note to the
         end time of the last note. For instance a phrase might have some negative time "pick-up" notes,
         and have the last note end before or after the logical end. dur is used for concat in
         knowing when the start time of the 2nd through nth phrases will be.
         Thus phrase durs are often 4 or 8 beats even though the actual duration of the
         notes in the phrase are longer or shorter.<br/>
        <b>velocity</b> Default: 0.5. A number from  though 1 inclusive indicating the default volume
           or loudness of the notes in a phrase when they aren't each given an explicit velocity.<br/>
           <i>Example:</i><br/>
            <code>new Phrase({velocity: 0.25, notes:"C D"})</code><br/>
            Both notes will have a velocity of 0.25, a low volume.<br/>
        <br/>
        <code>new Phrase({channel: 3, notes:"C D"})</code><br/>
        Both notes will have a channel of 3.<br/>
         <b>channel</b> Default: 1. An integer from 1 though 16 inclusive.<br/>
           <code>new Phrase({channel: 3, notes:"C D"})</code><br/>
           Both notes will have a channel of 3.
        <p></p>
        <i>Examples:</i><br/>
        <code>new Phrase("C E G")</code> A three note melody.<br/>
        <code>new Phrase("CEG")</code> A three note chord (C Major triad).<br/>
        <code>new Phrase({seconds_per_beat: 0.5, notes:"C E G"})</code><br/>
         A faster three note melody.
         <p></p>
        <code>new Phrase("C R G")</code><br/> A 2 note melody with a rest in the middle.
        Rests can have a duration ie "0.5R" but not an accidental or octave.
        <p></p>
        <pre><code>new Phrase({
     seconds_per_beat: 0.5,
      channel: 2,
      notes: `CEG CEG 0.5R 0.5FAC5 FAC5

        You may place a Phrase directly on the do_list of a Job.
        When that "instruction" is run, it will call the Phrase's start method
        to play it, and delay running the next instruction until the Phrase is done.

    </details>

    <details id="Phrase.concat_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>concat</summary>
    Takes any number of Phrases as arguments and
    concatenates them together with the subject. Each Phrase's "dur" is used
    to deterime the starting time of the next phrase. Use concat for
    making long phrases.
    </details>

    <details id="Phrase.filter_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>filter</summary>
        Employs <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Note.filter_doc_id', event)">Note.filter</a>
        to filter in or out notes.
        Takes the same parameters as Note.filter.
    </details>

    <details id="Phrase.merge_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>merge</summary>
    akes any number of Phrases as arguments and merges them together.
    The notes in the new returned phrase will have their same start times as
    their input start times. The resultant Phrase will have a dur that is the
    maximum of all the input phrases. Use merge for layering the parts of a piece
    together.
    </details>

    <details id="Phrase.pattern_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>pattern</summary>
    Pattern creates a phrase based on a pattern of other notes or phrases.
    Pattern is perhaps the highest level phrase processor. It exists only as a
    method on Phrases, not notes. It is also a <i>static</i> method in that it is
    called with a subject of the <code>Phrase</code> class itself, not an instance.<br/>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>pattern_array</b> Required. An array of non-negative integers that are less than
    the length of the phrase_library array. Each element refers to the phrase at that
    index in the phrase_library. The length of the pattern_array is the number of
    phrases to be used from the phrase_library. A given phrase in the phrase library
    maybe used zero or more times.<br/>
    <i>Example:</i><br/>
    <code>[0, 0, 1, 0]</code><br/>
    Here we are playing the first phrase in the phrase library, followed by playing
    that same phrase again, then the 2nd phrase in the phrase library and concluding
    with the first phrase. This implements the common pattern in poopular music of "AABA".<br/>
    <b>phrase_library</b> Required. An array of Notes and Phrases of possibilities to use
    in the output phrase. Each may be used zero or more times.<br/>
    <b>merge</b> Default: <code>false</code>. A boolean. If false,
    concat the phrases together in the returned phrase. If true, merge the phrases
    together. Using merge is unusual but an intriguing possibility of "layering"
    phrases on top of each other and having the pattern be a simultaneous one rather
    than a sequential one.
    <p></p>
    <i>Examples:</i>
    <pre><code>Phrase.pattern([0, 0, 1, 0],
           [new Phrase("C D"),
            new Phrase("E F")])
    </code></pre> =>
        <samp>new Phrase("C D C D E F C D")</samp><br/>
    Since both phrases in the library have 2 notes, think of the output as
    4 pairs of notes, where a pair is either "C D" or "E F".
    <p/>
    We can get the same output by inverting our pattern and reversing
    the phrases in our library like so:<br/>
    <pre><code>Phrase.pattern([1, 1, 0, 1],
       [new Phrase("E F"),
        new Phrase("C D")])
    </code></pre> =>
    <samp>new Phrase("C D C D E F C D")</samp>
    <p></p>
    There's no restriction that library items be the same length
    or even the same type as each other.
    <p></p>
    Here's a pattern using a Note and a Phrase in its library.
    <pre><code>Phrase.pattern([0, 1, 0],
        [new Note("C"),
         new Phrase("E F")])
    </code></pre>
     =>   <samp>new Phrase("C E F C")</samp>
     <p></p>
     Mixing and matching pattern_arrays and phrase_libraries is an important way to consider
     compositional choices in making music. By using JavaScript to automatically
     generate patterns (or even the phrases in a library), an enormous range
     of possibilities are available.

    <details id="Phrase.repeat_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>repeat</summary>
    Concatenates the given number of phrases into one long phrase and returns it.<br/>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>repetitions</b> Default: <code>2</code>. Can be fractional like 1.5
    to create a phrase that's 1.5 times as long as the first phrase.
    The last half of the 2nd repetition will be missing in the output.<br/>
    <i>Example:</i><br/>

        to filter in or out notes.
        Takes the same parameters as Note.time_interval.
        <p></p>
        It is different than filter in that it only deals with times and durs.
        time_interval will modify the time
        of notes that overlap start_time to start at the start time.
        It also changes the dur of any notes that overlap end_time such
        that they will end at end_time.

    <details id="Phrase.transpose_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>transpose</summary>
    Increments the pitch of all the notes in the input Phrase.<br/>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>

        or positive.<br/>
        <code>new Phrase("C D").transpose(1)</code><br/>=>
        <samp>new Phrase("C# D#")</samp>
         If an array, create a note for each interval in the array
        and include them all in the output phrase. This is quite useful for
        turning a base line into a chord progression.<br/>
        <code>new Phrase("C D").transpose([0, 4, 7])</code><br/>=>
        <samp>new Phrase("CEG DF#A")</samp>
        <br/>
        <b>key</b> Default: "chromatic". If "chromatic", increment the pitch of each

        <b>prop_name</b> The property within the Notes to set. One of:
        "time", "dur", "pitch", "velocity", "channel".

        <b>min</b> Default -2. (-2 is the lowest possible octave and thus the lowest likely
        valid new_value.) If new_value is less than min,
        then prop_name will be set to min.<br/>
        Does not apply to prop_name of "time".<br/>
        Usually a number but if prop_name is "pitch", new_value
        may also be a pitch name, i.e. "C#4".<br/>
        If min is null, no minimum is enforced.<br/>
        <b>max</b> Default 128. A number. If new_val is more than max,
        then prop_name will be set to max.
        Usually a number but if prop_name is "pitch",  new_value
        may also be a pitch name, i.e. "C#4".<br/>
        If max is null, no maximum is enforced.<br/>
        <i>Examples:</i><br/>
        <code>new Phrase("C D").set_property("pitch", 63)</code><br/>=>
        <samp>new Phrase("C#4 C#4")</samp><br/>
        </details>

        <details id="Phrase.increment_property_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>increment_property</summary>
        Similar to set_property with
        the 2nd argument being the amount to <i>increase</i> the given
        prop_name's value by. The increment number may be negative.<br/>
        <code>new Phrase("C D").increment_property("pitch", 1)</code><br/>=>
        <samp>new Phrase("C#4 D#4")</samp><br/>
        Note that incrementing pitch is a transpose, but we can increment
        any other note property.
        </details>

        <details id="Phrase.multiply_property_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>multiply_property</summary>
          Similar to set_property with
        the 2nd argument being the amount to <i>multiply</i> the given
        prop_name's value by. The multiplication factor may be negative.
        <code>new Phrase("C D").multiply_property("velocity", 2)</code>
        Since the default velocity is 0.5, the returned phrase
        will have all of its note at a velocity of 1 (the maximum).

    <details class="doc_details"><summary>Listening for MIDI input</summary>
        Even though GB has a soft keyboard, it can't send out Midi.
        You can download <a href="http://vmpk.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">VMPK software</a>
        for a virtual midi controller,
        for Mac/Windows/Linux. It has no synthesizers in it.
        <p></p>
        In the VMPK menu bar, choose "MIDI Connections".<br/>
        For "MIDI OUT Driver", choose "CoreMIDI".<br/>
        For "Output MIDI Connection" Choose "IAC Driver Bus 1"
        (the default on the Mac, it will be something else on Windows.)<br/>
        Click the OK button.<br/>
        Choose VMPK menu bar/Tools/Note Input/Computer Keyboard,<br/>
        and also in the same sub menu, "Mouse".<br/>
        Now click on the keyboard or hit a key (like "q")<br/>
        and you should see "Got Midi event..." in DDE.
        You should also hear the note played in GarageBand or any synthezier you have
        that listens to the appropriate MIDI channel.
        <p></p>
        VMPK has a nice feature for labeling the keys on its
        piano keyboard: Choose menu bar/View/Note names.
        <p></p>
        You can call a method when a particular kind of Midi event occurs.<br/>
        <i>Example:</i><br/>
        <code title="not in TestSuite">WebMidi.inputs[1].addListener('noteon',  "all", Midi.describe_midi_event)</code><br/>
        Above we are adding a listener on input 1.<br/>
        If you configured GarageBand as mentioned above, it will be on input[0], so
        input[1] will get you the VMPK keyboard.
        This listener is listening for Midi events of<br/>
        type "noteon". ("noteoff" is another choice here.)<br/>
        We are listening on "all" channels, but you can use an integer from 1 to 16 here to
        narrow this down to a particular channel.<br/>
        The last argument is a callback function.<br/>
        <code>Midi.describe_midi_event</code> is a DDE utility function that
        prints out important properties of the event that is passed as the one argument
        to the callback.<br/> Eval <code>Midi.describe_midi_event</code> to inspect
        its source code, which will show you how to
        access pitch, channel, velocity and other properties from the passed in event.

<details id="recognize_speech_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>recognize_speech</summary>
    Speech recognition has a long history in AI.
    It hasn't been taken advantage of where ever possible because:
    <ul><li>The accuracy of recognition has been poor.</li>
        <li>The API for calling the functionality has been poor.</li>
        <li>The user interface has been poor</li>
    </ul>
    DDE goes a long ways towards solving these problems.
    <ul><li>DDE uses Google's speech recognition. Although it isn't perfect,
           its much better than past systems and improving.</li>
        <li>DDE hides Google's API behind a much easier to call function and
            an comparitively easy to use do_list instruction, named
            Human.recognize_speech</li>
        <li>DDE's dialog box provides clear help to users with an option to
            type in text should recognition (or your network connnetion) fail.
            We also have a mechanism to correct recognition mistakes. (ie "for" vs "four").</li>
    </ul>
    Don't expect recognition to be as reliable as a human. Google's speech
    recognition sends digital audio over the net to be recognized on Google's servers.
    If you don't have: 
    <ul><li>a good microphone in your computer,</li>
        <li>a quiet room,</li>
        <li>a reliable net connection or</li>
        <li>a fast net connection</li>
    </ul>
        don't use recognize_speech.
        However, because of the type-in capability, programs written to take
        advantage of speech recognition in poor conditions can still
        be servicable via typing in instead of talking.
    <b><i>Be sure to crank up the volume of your mic.</i></b>
    <p></p>
    Recognized text comes with a <b>confidence</b> number indicating
    how good the recognizer <i>thinks</i> the text is at matching what you've said.
    In theory its nice to have this confidence number but in practice, it might
    not matter much. The number varies from 0 (unconfident) to 100 (very unconfident)
    though these numbers themselves might not be so, ahem, confident.
    Also in the middle of a session, you may well see network bugs even though
    it seems like your network is fine to you. 
    <p></p>
    If you are using speech to dictate
    a critical process, we recommend displaying or saying (via the <code>speak</code> function)
    the recognized text and asking the user for a simple <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i> confirmation.
    <p></p>
    When <b>recognize_speech</b> is called, it pops up a dialog telling you to speak. 
    The arguments to recognize_speech configure this dialog and the callbacks that receive the
    recognized text and confidence numbers. All of these are keyword arguments with defaults. See
    <button>Insert&#9660;</button> menu, <b>sound/recognize_speech</b> for an example call.
    <ul><li><b>title</b> Default: "Recognize Speech". Shows in the title bar of the dialog.
        </li>
        <li><b>prompt</b> Default: "". Displays instructions for the user at the top of the dialog.
            Can be any HTML.
        </li>
        <li><b>only_once</b> Default <code>true</code>. When <code>true</code>, the dialog is automatically closed at the end of the first phrase.
                                  When <code>false</code>, the dialog re-initializes after you pause and permits another phrase to be recognized.
                                  Say <i>finish</i> to close the dialog. 
        </li>
        <li><b>click_to_talk</b> Default <code>true</code>. When <code>true</code>, the user
             must click <button>click to talk</button> to start the recognition. 
             When <code>false</code>, recognition starts as soon as the dialog is shown,
             or as soon as it has recognized the previous phrase (when <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> only_once=false</code>).
             </li>
        <li><b>width</b> Default: <code>400</code>. The distance from the left edge of the dialog to the right edge in pixels.
        </li>
        <li><b>height</b> Default: <code>180</code>. The distance from the top edge of the dialog to the bottom in pixels.
             If you have multiple lines for the prompt, this should be increased. 
        </li>
        <li><b>x</b> Default: <code>400</code>. The distance from the left edge of the DDE window to the left edge of the dialog in pixels.
        </li>
        <li><b>y</b> Default: <code>200</code>. The distance from the top edge of the DDE window to the top of the dialog in pixels.
        </li>
        <li><b>background_color</b> Default: <code>"rgb(238, 238, 238)"</code> i.e. light gray. Can be one of the names (strings) in the color series.
        </li>
        <li><b>phrase_callback</b> Default <code>recognize_speech_default_phrase_callback</code>.
             This function is called when the user pauses after speaking. 
             It is passed the recognized text, and the confidence number (0 to 1).
             If only_once=true, only this callback is called.
             The default prints these two arguments into the Output pane.
         </li>
        <li><b>finish_callback</b> Default <code>null</code> meaning no action.
             This function is called when the user says the finish_phrase.
             It is passed an array of arrays. Each inner array has elements of the text
             and the confidence number of each phrase spoken in this use of recognize_speech.
             This argument is moot if <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> only_once=true</code>.
         </li>
         <li><b>finish_phrase</b> Default: <code>"finish"</code>. The phrase that the user should speak to
             end the dialog. Moot when <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> only_once=true</code>.
        </li>

<details id="speak_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>speak</summary>
<code>speak</code> uses text to speech technology.<br/>
<i>Parameter:</i><br/>
<b>speak_data</b> Default: "hello". If the argument is a literal object
with a field of "speak_data", then the value of "speak_data" is spoken
with vocal characteristics indiated by the other properties of
the literal object. Otherwise, the argument is the data to be spoken
directly.<br/>
<b>voice</b> Integer 0 through 3. Default: <code>0</code>
    Though the underlying software claims to support different "voices", we've
    noticed that changing the voice parameter from 0 through 3 does not change the
    actualy quality of the voice. Perhaps some day this will work.<br/>

<i>Examples:</i><br/>
<code>speak("testing 1, 2, 3")</code><br/>

<code title="not in TestSuite">speak(new Date())</code><br/>
<code title="not in TestSuite">speak(["It is now ", new Date()])</code>
<p></p>
By passing a literal object, you can control many aspects of <code>speak</code>.
The <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> speak_data</code> input can be any JavaScript data
(such as a boolean, a number, a date, an array, etc.) and it will do its best to say it out loud.<br/>

        <i>url</i> is a poorly designed language for transfering data on the web.
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator">Documentation.</a>
        It's normal behavior is as an asyncrhonous function call, where the
        call is typically on a web device known as a 'client', and it is sent to
        a different device on the web known as a 'server'.
        <p></p>
        Usually its used to
        get the content of a web page into a browser. Usually the content of a web page
        is written in a polyglot of languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) but
        we can use urls to retrieve data in other syntaxes such as JSON or just plain strings.
        <p></p>
        <i>make_url</i> does two things:
        <ol><li>Prepends "http://" to the url being constructed, if it looks like
            there is no protocol in the url already. If there is no "://" in the
            first 16 chars of the url, it prepends "http://". If you want a
            different protocol, such as https, or you are using "://" in the value

<details id='Job_doc_id' class="doc_details"><summary>Job</summary>
A job contains a do_list of instructions that it feeds one at a time, in order,
to a robot, to make things.
The syntax of defining a job is:
<pre><code>new Job({name: "my_job",
         robot: Robot.dexter0,
         do_list: [ Dexter.move_to([0, 0.5, 0.075]),
                    Control.wait_until(2)
                    //...
                   ]
        })</code></pre>
Defined jobs remain inert until they are started by clicking their button in the Output pane header
or evaling:<br/>
<code title="not in TestSuite"> Job.my_job.start()</code><br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> start</code> initializes the job and feeds the instructions in its do_list to
the job's robot, which executes the instructions.
Jobs either run to completion, error, or are stopped by the user via:
<ul><li>Clicking on a running Job's button, i.e. <button>my_job</button> in the Output pane</li>
    <li>Calling <code title="not in TestSuite">Job.my_job.stop_for_reason("interrupted", "why you want it stopped")</code></li>
    <li>In a running Job, executing the instruction:
         <a href="#" onclick='open_doc("Control.stop_job_doc_id")'><code>Control.stop_job()</code></a></li>
 </ul>
 You can stop all jobs by:
 <ul>
   <li>Clicking the the stop sign icon <img src='stop_sign.png'/>in the output pane</li>
   <li>Calling <code>Job.stop_all_jobs()</code></li>
</ul>

Stopped jobs may be restarted by calling <code title="not in TestSuite"> Job.my_job.start()</code> again.
This reinitializes the job with the original arguments passed to <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> new Job</code>
and runs the do_list instructions again.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Definition Time vs Run Time</summary>
    To fully understand how a job operates, you must understand the difference
    between <i>Job Definition Time</i> and <i>Job Run Time</i>.
    <p></p>
    <b>Job Definition Time</b></br/>
    When you select and evaluate the source code of a job, you are
    <i>defining</i> the Job. This simply uses JavaScript's <code>eval</code>
    function to evaluate the source code, just like evaling any source code.
    The result of evaling<br/>
    <code title="unEVALable">new Job({name: "my_job" ...})</code><br/>
    is an instance of the
    class Job. Once done, you can access the Job instance via
    <code title="unEVALable">Job.my_job</code><br/>
    Many properties of the job are accessible via, for example,
    <code>Job.my_job.name</code> , which returns the string of the Job's name.<br/>
    Of particular import is the do_list. In the case of:
    <pre><code>var ang1 = 90
new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [Dexter.move_all_joints(ang1)]
         })</code></pre>
    , evaluation sets the global variable <code>ang1</code> to 90.<br/>
    Then it sets Job.my_job to the new Job instance.
    Within this instance, the property Job.my_job.do_list will
    be effectively set to an array of instructions.
    We say "effectively" because the actual do_list isn't bound
    until the job is started. It is cached away so that it
    can be copied afresh for each starting of the job.
    But in any case, the do_list will now be an array containing
    just one instance of the move_all_joints instruction.
    This instance will have its joint1 angle set to 90 because <code>ang1</code>
    is evaled when the Job definition is evaluated, and <code>ang1</code> evals
    to 90. If you simply eval <code>Dexter.move_all_joints(90)</code>,
    you can inspect the returned object and see that it has an
    <i>array_of_angles</i> property storing where the Dexter's angles will
    be commanded to go when the Job is actually run.
    <p></p>
    <b>Job Run time</b></br/>
    Now let's walk through <i>Job Run Time</i>. You run a Job
    by clicking its <button>job name</button> button or by calling
    <code title="unEVALable">Job.my_job.start()</code><br/>
    One way to think of starting a job is that it is a <i>second</i> evaluation
    of the Job. Only this time, it is not using JavaScript's eval, it is using
    Job's special evaluator. Instead of taking an input of JavaScript source code,
    its taking input of the items on the do_list (created via JS eval when defining the Job)
    which can be of many different types.
    Each instruction is "evaluated" by the Job differently, depending on its type.
    (similar to JavaScript's eval!)
    In the case of an instance of the move_all_joints instruction,
    that instance is transformed to a lower level instruction
    that is very similar to what you get when evaluating
    <code>make_ins("a", 90)</code>, then the 90 is convertered from
    degrees into arcseconds, and sent to the Job's default robot, which better be a Dexter.
    <p></p>
    <b>Re-Running a Job</b></br/>
    After a job has finished, you can rerun it by clicking its
    <button>job name</button> button or calling its start method again.
    This does not redefine the job.
    So for instance, if between two runnings of a Job, we set our
    global variable of <code title="unEVALable">ang1</code> to 45,
    that will have no effect on
    the 2nd running of our job, because we are not re-evaluating
    <code title="unEVALable">ang1</code> or even
    <code title="unEVALable">Dexter.move_all_joints(ang1)</code>.
    Nor are we re-defining my_job.
    That Joint1 inside the instance of move_all_joints is still 90,
    so our 2nd running of my_job should behave the same, even
    if we modify the value of <code title="unEVALable">ang1</code>.
    Actually if you do re_run my_job, it won't be exactly the same
    because the Dexter robot will now be at a pose with Joint 1 equal to 90,
    so in our 2nd running, the robot won't move. But besides this initial
    "set up move", following moves would be the same between the two runnings.
    <p></p>
    <b>Functions on the do_list</b></br/>
    The most flexible of instruction types is a JavaScript function.
    This allows you to execute arbritary JavaScript at Job Run Time.
    You might need to do this because you want to use the current environment
    to help determine what instruction to run next. That current environment
    may not be knowable at Job Definition Time. Perhaps you want to
    verify that Dexter really is where you told it to go, or
    you want to check on the status of some other Job before
    proceeding with this one.
    <p></p>
    To run arbitrary JS code during the running of a Job, wrap that code
    in a function definition like so:
    <pre><code>new Job({name: "my_job",
        do_list: [function(){return Dexter.move_all_joints(ang1)}]
        })</code></pre>
    We could also do:
    <pre><code>function move_it_buddy(){return Dexter.move_all_joints(ang1)}
new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [move_it_buddy]
        })</code></pre>
    particulary helpful for long functions or functions we want to
    call multiple times.
    <p></p>
    We are not doing:
    <code title="unEVALable">do_list: [move_it_buddy()]</code> because
    we don't want to CALL <code title="unEVALable">move_it_buddy</code>, as that would put its result on
    the do_list at define time. We just want to eval the global variable
    <code title="unEVALable">move_it_buddy</code> to put its value, a function definition, onto the do_list
    at define time.
    <p></p>
    When a JavaScript function is called,
    including when a running Job calls a function definition on its do_list,
    it sets local variables of the function's parameters to the values passed in,
    and evaluates the code in the body of the function.
    <p></p>
    In the cases above, <code title="unEVALable">ang1</code> <i>will</i> be evaled at Job Run Time,
    as will the code that creates the instance of move_all_joints.
    Anything returned by a function definition on the do_list will be
    dynamically added to the do_list right below the function definition.
    Our do_list started out with just one item, but after running
    that one item, our do_list is extended by an instance of move_all_joints.
    That instance of move_all_joints is inserted into the do_list immediately after
    the function that generated it, making it run immediately after the function.
    So now, if we change the value of ang1 between two runnings of my_job,
    we won't have to redefine the whole job in order to get the effect
    of changing the value of ang1.
    <p></p>
    A function definition on a do_list doesn't
    have to return anything. It may just have side effects like calling <code>out</code>
    for a print statement. But if it returns something that is not a valid instruction,
    the Job will error.
    <p></p>
    <b>Job Instance Access</b><br/>
    If you want to access the running Job Instance at run time, use a
    function definition on the do_list, and reference <code>this</code> in
    the body of that function definition.<br/>
    <i>Example:</i><br/>
    <pre><code>new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list:[function(){ this.user_data.foo = 2},
                 function(){ out("foo: " + this.user_data.foo +
                                 ", robot: " + this.robot.name) }
                 ]})
    </code></pre>
    Note that using <code title="unEVALable">user_data</code> is a convenient way to pass values from one
    instruction to another, without cluttering the global variable space.<br/>
    <b>Flexibility and Complexity</b><br/>
    Jobs have a great deal of flexibility. We can use the full power of
    a general purpose programming language plus DDE's libraries
    to define them. During their
    running, Jobs can also use the the full power of
    a general purpose programming language plus DDE's libraries, or any
    that you import or create.
    <p></p>
    Though powerful, this flexibility comes
    at the cost of complexity. Using JavaScript's function defining
    capability, you can hide (but not eliminate) many details.
    Also, DDE attempts to make writing JavaScript and Jobs as simple as
    possible, but it is still not simple, especially if you want
    to understand what's going on beneath the surface. The goal of Dexter
    is to enable you to make as many things as possible. This is why DDE needs to be so flexible.
    <p></p>
    For a more complete understanding of JavaScript eval, see the DDE article:

</details>

<details id="new_job_parameters_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>new Job parameters</summary>
The parameters used to define a new Job all have defaults.<br/>
<code> new Job() </code><br/>
is a valid job to define and run, though it will give a warning message:<br/>
    <span style="color:#e50;">Warning: While starting job: job_1, the do_list is empty.<br/>
    The job still requests the status of Dexter, but does not cause it to move.</span><br/>
    You can customize a job with the parameters:
    <ol><li id="job_param_name_doc_id"><b>name</b> Default's to an unused name of the format: <code>"job_1"</code>, <code>"job_2"</code>, <code>"job_3"</code>, etc.
         You can use <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.a_job_name</code> to get the instance programmatically.</li>
        <li id="job_param_robot_doc_id"><b>robot</b> Default: <code>Robot.dexter0</code> An instance of one of the subclasses of <code>Robot</code>, such as
            <code>Dexter</code>. This is the <i>default</i> robot to send the job's instructions to if
            the instruction itself doesn't designate a robot. The default for a Job's default robot is
            <code>Robot.dexter0</code>. For example, if we have:
         <pre><code title="unEVALable">new Job({do_list: [Dexter.move_all_joints([0, 10, 20, 30, 40]),
                   Robot.dexter1.move_all_joints([0, 10, 20, 30, 40]) ]})
             </code></pre>
            The 1st instruction will be sent to <code>Robot.dexter0</code> (the default),
            and the 2nd to <code  title="unEVALable">Robot.dexter1</code>.
            You can also use a Serial robot instance as the subject of a "string_instruction"
            instruction so that you can have one job that feeds instructions to
            multiple serial robots as well as multiple Dexters.
         </li>
        <li id="job_param_do_list_doc_id"><b>do_list</b> Default: <code>[]</code> (an empty array). An array of instructions to be sent to the job's robot when the
             Job is run. There are a number of different kinds of instructions, including
             user-defined JavaScript functions that can call arbitrary JS code.
             <p></p>
             Instructions may add additional instructions to the do_list by returning
             them as a single instruction or an array of instructions.
             Such instructions are inserted into the do_list just below the instruction that 
             made them.
             <p></p>In the source code of a Job definition, the code for a do_list must evaluate
             to an array. <br/>
             Normally a Job definition will look something like:
             <pre><code>
new Job({name: "my_job",
      do_list: [IO.out("hi")]})
      </code></pre>
            The call to <code>IO.out</code> is evaled when the call to new Job is evaled.
            <code title="unEvalable">IO.out("hi")</code> evals to an instruction object.
            (Go ahead and select the call to IO.out and click
            <button>Eval</button> .)
            It is that object which is put on the do_list.
            If that call to IO.out was inside a function and returned,
            and that function was on the do_list, the result of the IO.out
            would be put on the do_list.
            If instead we had put on our do_list:
<pre><code title="unEVALable">
new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [out("hi")]})
</code></pre>
        The call to <code>out</code> returns its argument.
        (It is useful in a debugging context to wrap <code>out</code> around
        some intermediate value.) Since "hi" is a string,
        that will be what would go on the do_list.
        However, that's not a valid item for a do_list, so
        the above call to new Job will error.
        <p></p>
        Instructions are documented with the kind of robot that they run on.
        For a list of valid instructions, see

        </li>
        <li id="job_param_keep_history_doc_id"><b>keep_history</b> true or false, Default: <code>true</code>. If true, the robot_status arrays
            returned from running instructions on the robot
            are stored in <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.the_job_name.rs_history</code>.
            This is useful for debugging, but uses memory, which can be
            saved by setting keep_history to <code>false</code>.</li>
        <li id="job_param_show_instructions_doc_id"><b>show_instructions</b> Possible values:
           <ul><li><code>true</code> The default. Each time Dexter begins the execution of an instruction, it
               is printed in the Output pane, refreshing that section of the output pane as
               each new instruction is run. The method used is <code>Job.prototype.show_progress</code>.
               Eval that to see its source code.</li>

                   A function written for this purpose is
                   <code>Job.prototype.show_progress_and_user_data</code>.
                   This allows you to see user data as it is updated by the job.
                   Eval the above code to see the method's source code.</li>
           </ul>
           See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc(print_statements_doc_id, event)">print statements</a>
         </li>
        <li id="job_param_inter_do_item_dur_doc_id"><b>inter_do_item_dur</b> Default: <code>0.01</code> A number indicating the number of seconds between
           when an instruction is completed by its robot, and when the next instruction is
           computed and sent to the robot of the job. This "taking a breath" gives other
           jobs a chance to run. Default 100.</li>
        <li id="job_param_user_data_doc_id"><b>user_data</b> Default <code>{}</code> (an empty object). A literal object of name-value pairs where arbitrary data created
           at the beginning of a job or during the execution of an instruction can be stored
           and retrieved.
           It can be initialized in the call to new job like so:<br/>
           <code>new Job ({name:"j22", user_data:{color: "blue", weight: 123} })</code><br/>
           Within an instruction, you can get a user_data value via 
           <br/><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this.user_data.color</code><br/>
           or set it via<br/>
           <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this.user_data.color = "green"</code><br/>
           You can set existing user_data names or create new ones by setting them.
           <p></p>
           user_data is persistent only while a job is executing. If you restart the
           job, its user_data is lost. For data that you want to persist across restarts,
           or for user_data that doesn't really belong with any one job but is used
           by mulitple ones, use the <i>class</i> property <code>Job.global_user_data</code>.
           This can be written to like so: <code>Job.global_user_data.my_count = 123</code>.
           <p></p>
           The value for user_data is passed in when creating a job is shallow_copied when
           the job starts. So if this value was stored in some external-to-the-job way
           and a job is run twice with that very same user_data, the 2nd time the job
           is started, it will see <i>the same</i> top level keys as the first time,
           and all the top level values that are immutable (booleans, strings, numbers).
           However, if there is a mutable value (say an element of an array or a literal object,
           the first job might have modified that and that modification will be see
           when the job is run a 2nd time. Mostly all this doesn't matter because
           most jobs don't use user_data at all. Others look at it but don't
           write to it, and most of the others would only write top level, immutable
           values to it. But nested mutable data in user_data can "leak" over to
           another running of a job, or even other jobs. This might or might not
           be what you want.
           <p></p>
           <code>Job.global_user_data</code> is initialized to <code>{}</code> when DDE launches.
           You can store data here that you wish to persist across running jobs, but realize
           that if a job modifies <code>Job.global_user_data</code>, the 2nd time that
           job is run, it will see a different <code>Job.global_user_data</code> than the first.        
           If you want data to persist across launches, see 
           <b>Reference Manual/IO/Persistent Database</b>.         
           </li>
        <li id="job_param_default_workspace_pose_doc_id"><b>default_workspace_pose</b>
            Default: <code>Coor.Table</code> .
            <p/>
            <code>Dexter.move_to</code>
            and <code>Dexter.pid_move_to</code>
            instructions take an argument of: workspace_pose.
            (See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Dexter.move_to_doc_id')">Dexter.move_to</a>)<br/>
          If you have a move_to instruction in a Job's do_list that is not passed
          a pose, it defaults to the value of the Job's default_workspace_pose.<br/>
          Below we show a Job with a move_to instruction that does <i>not</i>
          default it's workspace_pose, but rather creates it explicitly.
          A pose is composed of an xyz array, and an orientation array.<br/>
          <i>Example:</i><br/>
<pre><code>new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [Dexter.move_to([-0.1, 0.4, 0.075],

        <li id="job_param_program_counter_doc_id"><b>program_counter</b> Default: <code>0</code> Initialize the program_counter to an instruction id.
         Use this when you want  a job to start with an instruction other than
         the first instruction in the do_list. Thus you can skip performing some of
         the initial instructions when running the job.
         This is most commonly a non-negative integer but

            will not execute the indicated instruction or beyond. This can be any
            valid instruction_location that does not include a job. It is evaluated
            at the start of each instruction, so if labels move as a result of

             <code>"wait"</code> The job waits for another instruction to be added
               at the end of the do_list. Call <code><a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Job.insert_instruction_doc_id')">Job.insert_instruction</a></code>
               from any JavaScript code to do this.<br/>
             <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> A function</code> When the job reaches its normal stopping point,
             the function is called with a 'this' of the job instance and no arguments.
             This is effectively a callback when the job is done.<br/>
             <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> An instruction location</code> This is similar to Control.go_to

             Using an instruction location 'offset' of greater than 0, such as a label,
             will cause the initial running of the job to execute its top instructions,

    <i>Example:</i><br/>
    <code title="unEVALable">Job.my_job.robot</code> gets the default robot for the job.<br/>
    To access these properties from an instruction in a running job, use a function definition
    on the do_list. When a running job encounters a function definition on its do_list,
    it calls that function with no arguments, but with a <code>this</code> of
    the job instance. From that you can get the Job's properties like so:<br/>
    <pre><code>new Job ({name: "my_job",
          do_list: [function(){out(this.robot.name)}]})</code></pre>
    where <code>this</code> refers to <code title="unEVALable">Job.my_job</code>.
    When run, my_job prints its default robot's name to the Output pane.

<details id="start_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>start</summary>
   <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> start</code> is an instance method on <code>Job</code> that
   causes the job instance to feed its do_list to the Job's robot instance.
   After a job instance is done running, you can call <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> start</code>
   again to run it again.<p></p>
   <i>Example</i> <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job.start()</code><p></p>
   <i>Parameters</i><br/>
   <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> start</code> takes an object literal as its argument with the
   same names and values as <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> new Job</code> except that it can't
   take "name" as a property (i.e. you can't rename the job when you start it).
   Below are two of the most useful properties you can use:
   <ul>
    <li><b>program_counter</b> Initialize the program_counter to an instruction id.
        The default is 0. You can use any instruction_location here.
        See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Control.go_to_doc_id', event)">Control.go_to</a>
        for documentation on all the different kinds of instruction_locations.
    </li>
    <li><b>initial_instruction</b> Add an initial instruction to the do_list at
        the location of program_counter. Thus this instruction will be executed
        first when the job is run. Default null (no instruction added).
    </li>
    </ul>
    Note that these parameters override the same-named properties used in making
    a new job, but they are only used for this call to start. They
    do not perminently affect the job definition.<br/>
    <i>Example</i>:<br/>
    <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job.start({program_counter: "highest_completed_instruction_or_zero"})</code><br/>
    If a job errored the last time it ran, you can use this to restart the job
    with the errored instruction being the first one run.
</details>

<details id="Job.insert_instruction_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>insert_instruction</summary>
Insert an instruction into a Job's do_list at a particular location.<br/>
<i>Parameters</i>:<br/>
<b>instruction</b> The instruction to insert. This can be an array of instructions
if you effectively want to insert more than one.<br/>
<b>location</b> Any instruction_location documented under
              <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Control.go_to_literal_doc_id', event)">Control.go_to literal</a> can be used
including integers, names of labels, etc. <br/>

                        offset: "end"})</code></pre><br/>
Adds an instruction that prints "the end" at the end of <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job.do_list</code>.<br/>
The instruction <code>Control.send_to_job</code> performs the core of this functionality
in an instruction format.<br/>

<details id="Robot_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Robot</summary>
  A robot is a machine that can execute the instructions in its instruction set. In general,
  each kind of robot will have its own instruction set. The primary
  difference between robots is the difference in their instruction sets.
  <p></p>
  All Jobs have a default <i>robot</i> property. You can access the robot property
  from a running job like so:<br/>
  <pre><code>new Job ({name: "my_job",
          do_list: [function(){ this.robot }]})</code></pre>
    where <code>this</code> refers to <code title="unEVALable">Job.my_job</code>.<br/>
    You might use this to print out the current robot's name, by replacing<br/>
    <code title="unEVALable">this.robot</code> with:<br/>
    <code title="unEVALable">out(this.robot.name)</code>
  
<details id="robot_instructions_doc_id" class="doc_details" ><summary>Robot Instructions</summary>
These instructions can be used for any robot, as can the instructions for
the Human robot.

    <details  class="doc_details"><summary>Any Array of Instructions</summary>
        Any valid instruction can be wrapped in an array of any length
        and put on a do_list. This is often useful when you have a function
        that makes a number of instuctions. The instructions need not be of the same type.
        <p></p>
        An empty array is valid but will have no effect.<br/>
        Arrays may be nested to any depth.<br/>
        <i>Example:</i><br/>
        <pre><code>new Job({name: "Job1",
         do_list: [[Dexter.move_all_joints([10, 20, 0, 0, 0]), IO.out("did it")],
                    function(){
                        let result = []
                        for(let ang = 0; ang <= 90; ang += 15){
                             result.push(Dexter.move_all_joints([ang, 0,0,0,0,]))
                        }
                        return result
                    }
                   ]})
     </code></pre>
        The first insruction above puts 1 array with two instructions on the do_list.
        Both will be run in order.
        The second instruction, an anonymous function definition,
        creates an array of <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code> instructions.
        Those instructions have Joint 1 increasing in angles from 0 through 90,
        incrementing by 15 degrees.
        <p></p>
        If we have a function (fun1) which returns an array of instructions, and a second
        function (fun2) that returns a different array of instructions,
        and we wanted to return them all, we could write:
        <pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite">new Job({name: "Job1",
         do_list: [function(){ return [fun1(), fun2()] }
        ]})
        </code></pre>
        We could also write:
        <pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite">new Job({name: "Job1",
         do_list: [function(){ return [fun1, fun2] }
        ]})
         </code></pre>
        as long as those functions take no arguments.<br/>
        We could also just put both at top level on the do_list,
        i.e. <pre><code title="unEVALable"/>new Job({name: "Job1",
         do_list: [fun1, fun2]
        })
            </code></pre>
        DDE gives you lots of options!
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Any JS Function Def</summary>
Any function definition can be put on the do_list as an instruction.
When it is run, the function is called with <code>this</code>
being the instance of Job that the function def is in. Since you can put any
JavaScript inside a function definition, you can have an instruction
execute any JS whatsoever.
<p></p>
Often you'll make functions that have no returned value.
If so, after the function is called, then the next instruction
on the do_list will be run. But if the function returns
another instruction, or an array of instructions, then those
will be inserted into the do_list immediately below the
function def, and they will be run next.
<p></p>
<i>The below functionality is advanced use of DDE.</i><br/>
The function
body might have an <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> if</code> in it. Under certain
conditions the function will return one instruction,
and it other cases, it will return another (or <code>null</code>, meaning
just do the next instruction on the do_list, or an array of
instructions to do them all).
<p></p>
If a function returns the special string
<code>"dont_call_set_up_next_do"</code>,
then that will cause nothing to happen in the job. It won't advance.
This is not a good thing to do by itself, but you might
want to conditionally call
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this.set_up_next_do()</code>. This tells DDE to
continue processing this job's instructions.
The argument to this function is an integer saying how much
to increment the program counter. It defaults to 1, meaning
do the next instruction. Another useful value is 0,
which will mean that after a short pause, run this instruction
again. Then in some other running of the instruction, a different
branch of an <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> if</code> may be taken that will call
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this.set_up_next_do(1)</code> causing the job to proceed.
<i>Example</i>:<pre><code>function pause_a_bit(){
   if (new Date().getSeconds() < 30){
      this.set_up_next_do(0)
   }
   else {
      this.set_up_next_do(1)
   }
   return "dont_call_set_up_next_do"
}
</code></pre>
The above example could better be implemented using
<code>Control.wait_until</code>, but there are
cases where the increased flexibility of the above is convenient.
<p></p>
You can put both named and anonymous functions on a do_list.
A named instruction allows you to add a bit of "documentation" to
the function. You can also use the name of a function like a
label and "go to"
that name using a <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Control.go_to_doc_id', event)">Control.go_to</a> instruction,
or use the function's name in
any uses of an instruction_location.
<p></p>
If you name your function definition,
you can define it <i>outside</i> of the do_list, then just
have its name in the do_list source code. This lets you put
the same function in multiple locations on the do_list and
only have to define it once.
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Any JS Code</summary>
If you have some JavaScript code that you want to go between 2
other instructions on a Job's do_list, your first inclination
might be to just stick it on the do_list like so
<pre><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> do_list: [IO.out("hi"),
          my_fn(12, 34),
          IO.out("bye")
          ]
</code></pre>
What happens here is that when the <i>definition</i> of the job is evaled,
the function my_fn will be called with args 12 and 34.
Whatever that function returns will be put on the do list
between the other 2 instuctions.
So if my_fn  <i>returns</i> an instruction to run, and the making of that instruction
does not depend on anything that happens while running the instructions of the job,
then you're all set.
<br/>
<b>BUT</b> if what you want is for the eval of <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> my_fn(12, 34)</code>
to occur after the instruction returned by <code>IO.out("hi")</code> is run,
then you'll want to wrap your code in a function, and put the definition
of that wrapper function on the do_list like so:<br/>
<code>function(){ my_fn(12, 34) }</code><br/>
In the body of the above function, <code>this</code> will be bound
to the instance of the running job.
Note that if calling my_fn returns an instruction (or an array of instructions)
that you want to run in the job, then our code for this do_list item should
look like:
    <code>function(){ return my_fn(12, 34) }</code>
<p></p>
If you are confused about what a given instruction on a Job's do_list
returns, just select it in the editor and EVAL it.
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Any JS Generator</summary>
A relatively new feature of JavaScript is generators.
A generator is a function that can effectively return a value
in the middle of its definition via 'yield', then be called again
and resume after the previous 'yield'.
<a target="_blank" href="https://davidwalsh.name/es6-generators">Tutorial</a>
<p></p>
A generator can be used as a do-list instruction.
Running a job automatically handles the re-calling
of a generator until it is exhausted i.e. no more
yield statements, or a return statement is executed.
<p></p>
Generators are useful when you want to dynamically compute
a bunch of instructions, but are not sure how many until
after you've started generating the instructions. Real-time
control or interaction with other jobs often have these chracteristics.
<p></p>
Usually a generator will have one or more yield statements
with a following value of a dynamcially computed instruction
to insert and run in the job. The software that controls
the execution of instructions in a Job will call a generator's
"next" method until the "done" flag is returned,
in which case the generator is done and on the
next iteration of the job, the following instruction will
be run.
<p></p>
You may have a yield statement
with nothing following it to simply do nothing for
that iteration, but the generator will still be called
for the next job iteration until the generator is exhausted.
<p></p>
<p>The body of a generator looks like a function.
Often its yield statement(s) will be wrapped in a loop,
that has an <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> if</code> statement with
a clause (or more) that terminates the loop by calling <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> return</code>
and a clause (or more) that uses <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> yield</code> to produce
an instruction.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><pre><code>
function* my_gen(){
  while(true){
    if(Math.random() > 0.2) {
        yield IO.out("my_gen still alive")
    }
    else { return IO.out("gotta go") }
  }
}
new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [my_gen]})
</code></pre>
See DDE menu bar/Jobs/Insert Example/Generators<br/>
for code examples. Related Job facilities are:
<ul><li>
 using instruction
<code>Control.wait_until("new_instruction")</code></li>
<li>Job parameter: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> when_stopped</code></li>
</ul>
</details>

<details id="start_object_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Any Start Object</summary>
<i>Caution: this is advanced functionality not needed by
simple uses of DDE.</i>
<p></p>
In the body of an ordinary JavaScript function with a sequence
of top level function calls, a function call will begin
executing as soon as the previous function call returns.
But sometimes we don't want that
because a preceeding call may "return" but it is not really done,
since it has passed processing off to another process. In order to
delay the start of another call, there are various tricks in
JS.
<p></p>
One of the tricks JS uses is to pass a function a "callback" function
as an argument. Then when the original function is really "done",
it calls the callback function.
<p></p>
A DDE Job and its do_list is another way to carefully control
when "instructions" on the do_list are started.
DDE has a number of instruction types that help you control
when the next instruction is run. A primary one is called
<a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Control.wait_until_doc_id', event)">wait_until</a>
that blocks the processing of the following instruction.
<p></p>
In order to provide a more general mechanism to handle such methods
without special casing Job processing for each one, we've invented the
<i>start_object</i> instruction. This is not like other more constrained
instructions, but it does fit a pattern that you can leverage to
accomplish a wide variety of tasks by reusing code written by others
within a Job that you create.
<p></p>
A start_object is any JS object that has a method named start.
After a Job's instruction prcessing has exhausted all other possibilities,
it looks to see if an instruction has a start method.
If it does not, it errors with "invalid instruction type".
But if it does, it calls the <code title="unEVALable">start</code> method with the instruction object
as <code title="unEVALable">this</code>. Classes whose instances have start
methods in DDE include:
<ul><li><code>Job</code> the Job is started and the next instruction in the do_list
         is run immediately.</li>
    <li><code>Note</code> a musical note. The note is played, but the next instruction
        is not run until the note is finished playing. For the note to sound,
         you must have called <code title="not in TestSuite">Midi.init()</code> and connected
         a synthesizer (hardware or software).
    </li>
    <li><code>Phrase</code> A sequence of notes. Played under similar conditions to Note.</li>
    <li><code>TestSuite</code> A sequence of tests that test validity. The start method
        runs all the tests and populates properties of the TestSuite instance of
        <code title="unEVALable">known_failure_count</code>, (non-negative integer)<br/>
        <code title="unEVALable">unknown_fallure_count</code>,(non-negative integer)<br/> and
        <code title="unEVALable">report</code> (string hf HTML).
</ul>
There are several other properties that control the starting, processing and the
delay caused by start_objects.
<ul><li><b>start_args</b> Default: <code>null</code>
If the start_object has a property named "start_args",
its value is used to supply arguments to the start method when it is called.
If the method accepts arguments in the  normal, by_position configuration<br/>
<i>Example:</i> <code title="unEVALable">foo(1, 2, 3)</code><br/>
start_args should be an array. However, if the method takes arguments
by keyword<br/>
 <i>Example:</i> <code title="unEVALable">foo({a: 1, b:2})</code><br/>
 then start_args should be a literal object.</li>

<li><b>callback_param</b> If this property is present and non-null,
it indicates that a callback function will be created by DDE and
passed to the start function at the position indicated by the
callback_param's value. If start_args is an array, callback_param,
if present, must be a non-negative integer. The start method will
have the callback method passed at that position in the argument list.
For instance, if the start_args are <code>["one", "two"]</code> and the
callback_param is <code>2</code> then the call to start will look like<br/>
<code title="unEVALable">the_start_object.start("one", "two", function(){...}</code>
<p></p>
However, if start_args is a literal object, then the callback_param,
if present, must be a string that names the keyword of the callback function
in the argument list. For instance,
if the start_args are<br/>
<code>{speak_data: "hi there"}</code> and the
callback_param is<br/>
<code>"callback"</code>, then the
call will look like: <br/>
<code title="unEVALable">the_start_object.start({speak_data: "hi there", callback: function(){...}</code>
</li>

<li><b>dur</b> If there's no callback_param but there is a dur, then
     the Job will pause for the number of seconds in the dur field before
     running the next instruction.
<pre><code>new Job({name: "Job1",
      do_list: [{start: function(){out("wait a sec or 3")},
                 dur: 3},
                 IO.out("done")]})
      </code></pre></li>
<li><b>user_data_variable</b> Default: <code>null</code> If present and non-null,
 the automatically synthesized callback
function will set the given user_data variable in the job to an array of
the arguments passed to the callback function. This is so that
subsequent instructions can retrieve the real result of the start method
and use them. For instance, if the value the of user_data_variable is <code>"foo"</code>,
then after this instruction has completed,<br/>
<code title="unEVALable">job_instance.user_data.foo = ["array", "of", "args", "passed", "to the callback"]</code></li>
</ul>
<i>Examples:</i>
<pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite">new Job({name: "my_job1",
         do_list: [IO.out("hey from my_job1")]})
new Job({name: "my_job2",
         robot: new Brain({name: "brain2"}),
         do_list: [Job.my_job1]})
         </code></pre>
When Job.my_job2 is started, it will cause my_job1 to start
by calling its start method (the same way you can programmatcally
start a Job).
Immediately after starting my_job1,
my_job2 runs its "next" instruction, but since there isn't one,
my_job2 will finish, perhaps before my_job1 does.
<pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite">
new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [function(){Midi.init()},
                   new Note("E"),
                   new Note("D"),
                   new Note("C"),
                   new Note("R"), //rest
                   new Phrase("G F E"),
                   new Note("R"),
                   new Phrase("2/3G 1/3G 2/3F 1/3F E") //triplets
                  ]})
        </code></pre>
When a note is created, it has a duration (default 1 second).
The above plays a melody, with each note waiting for the previous note to
complete because running start_object checks for a "dur" field and,
if present, waits for that amount of time before proceedng to the next
instruction.<br/>
See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('music_with_midi_doc_id', event)">Music with MIDI</a>.
<pre><code>
new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [{start: function(){out("wait a sec or 3")},
                    dur: 3},
                   IO.out("done waiting")]})
    </code></pre>
    Above when the job starts, the first instruction's start method is
    called, which prints in the Output pane, "wait a sec or 3".
    Then there's a pause of 3 seconds
    (the value of "dur" in the start_object).
    Finally the Job's 2nd instruction is run
    and prints out "done waiting".

<pre><code>new Job({name: "my_job",
    do_list: [IO.out("hey"),
    {start: speak,
     start_args: {speak_data: "Clean my work space.", rate:0.8},
     callback_param: "callback",
     user_data_variable: "the_text"
    },
    {start: speak,
     start_args: {speak_data: "Don't forget the end effector.", rate:1.2},
     callback_param: "callback",
     user_data_variable: "the_text2"
    },
    IO.out("you")
    ]})
    </code></pre>
    The above job first prints out "hey", then speaks
    "Clean my work space." slowly, then speaks
    "Don't forget the end effector." faster,
    and when that's done, finally prints out "you".<br/>
    To run the first speak instruction, DDE evals an automatically synthesized call
    that looks like:
    <pre><code title="unEVALable">the_start_object.start({speak_data: "Clean my work space.",
                        rate:0.8,
                        callback: function(...args){
                                    job_instance.user_data.the_text = args
                                    job_instance.wait_until_this_prop_is_false = false
                        }})
            </code></pre>
    When its all done, Job.my_job.user_data.the_text has a value of the
    array of args passed to the synthesized callback function,
    for use by subsequent instructions.
    <pre><code>function test_cb(a, b, callback){
    out("got: " + a + " " + b)
    callback(b, a, 123)
    }
new Job({name: "my_job",
    do_list: [IO.out("hey"),
    {start: test_cb,
    start_args: [11, 22],
    callback_param: 2,
    user_data_variable: "the_args_to_the_cb"
    }]})
    </code></pre>
    Above we define a "start" method so you can get a little deeper insight.
    We call it "test_cb". It looks like a normal method in that it has
    args. The first thing it does is print out its first two arguments.
    But its 3rd argument is a method that is called in the 2nd (and last) line
    of the method with the original args a and b reversed in order
    and one extra arg, 123.
    <p></p>
    On the Job's do_list, we have a start_object because it is
    an object with a method as the value of the "start" property
    of the object. Note that it doesn't matter that the real method
    being called is named "test_cb". What's important is that
    the start_object has a field named "start" whose value is some function.
    <p></p>
    When our Job is run, the first instruction is run by
    calling the value of the "start" property with arguments
    [11, 22, synthesized_callback_fn]. Then test_cb is run
    and it executes its<br/>
     <code title="unEVALable">out("got: " + a + " " + b)</code><br/>
     then calls <code title="unEVALable">callback(b, a, 123)</code>
     which sets the value of<br/>
    <code title="unEVALable">Job.my_job.user_data.the_args_to_the_cb</code>
    to <samp>[22, 11, 123]</samp> Note that we reversed the order of a & b
    just to show flexibility here.
    <p></p>
    We can make jobs that have any combination of the above kinds of
    start_objects, plus others, plus any other valid instructions.
    They will all wait for each other (if so configured).
    <p></p>
    This syntax is complex, but not as complex as other ways of
    doing the same thing and makes Jobs significantly more flexible than
    they already were.

<details id="Control.go_to_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>go_to</summary>
In the 1960's programs were usually characterized by a list of instructions.
As more flexible control was needed, the "goto" instruction was added to
cause the program_counter that was pointing at the executing instruction to jump to
a new location, instead of just incrementing. Overuse
of this control structure gave rise to difficult-to-debug code and
goto fell out of favor, to the extent that it isn't even <i>in</i> popular modern
general purpose languages.
<p></p>
The process of making things often has a long list
of instructions that are executed sequentially. DDE provides the
more conventional function calling, including return, if, and for loops.
But sometimes the most convenient thing to do is "leap over" some instructions
on a job's do_list and proceed from there.
Thus DDE provides the taboo <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> go_to</code> instruction.
Don't use it a lot. Going backwards is particularly dangerous.
But we give you enough rope to hang yourself or build a masterpiece.
<p></p>
DDE's go_to is more versatile than go_to's of the past.
If this complexity is too hard, just don't use it.
<p></p>
The go_to instruction takes just one argument: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_location</code>.
It has a number of different kinds of arguments.<br/>
<b>a positive integer</b> Moves the program counter to the indicated instruction id.
The instruction at that id will be the one executed after the go_to instruction.<br/>
<b>a negative integer</b> Sets the program counter to the length of the
do_list, plus this negative integer. Thus an integer of -1 sets the program counter
to the last instruction, so that it will be executed next. -2 goes to the second to last
instruction, etc.<br/>
<b>the name of a label instruction</b> The program counter is set to that label's id.<br/>
<b>the name of a sync_point instruction</b> The program counter is set to that instruction's id.<br/>
<b>the name of a function def instruction</b> The program counter is set to that instruction's id.<br/>
<b>the type of instruction</b> Examples:
<code>"go_to"</code> <code>"label"</code> <code>"sync_point"</code> etc.
For example, if we have "label", then we're not going to a specific label, just
the next instruction of type "label" found.<br/>
<b>Instruction oplet</b> Low level instructions to Dexter have a letter that
designates their type. For example <code>"a"</code> would refer to
the <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code> instruction. You can see the oplet for
an instruction by evaling the call to make it, i.e. <code>Dexter.move_all_joints([45])</code><br/>
<b>"program_counter"</b> Set's the program_counter to the program_counter. Only useful
when the instruction_location is an array. <br/>
<b>"before_program_counter"</b> Set's the program_counter to the instruction just
before the program_counter.<br/>
<b>"after_program_counter"</b> Set's the program_counter to the instruction just
    after the program_counter.<br/>
<b>"end"</b> Sents the program counter to one greater than the last instruction id,
effectively ending the job.<br/>
<b>"next_top_level"</b> A top level instruction can cause multiple instructions to
be inserted right beneath it. This sets the program counter to the next top level
instruction, even though it may now be executing "sub" instructions. <br/>
<b>"highest_completed_instruction"</b> When you are re-starting a job, this
becomes handy to start the job at the last instruction that completed.
Perhaps the instruction completed, but it inadvertently caused an error.
You can fix the problem, then rerun that last instruction and continue on.
Take care to not execute that last instruction twice if you don't want to.
You can go one beyond it like so:<br/>
<code>["highest_completed_instruction", 1]</code><br/>
<b>"highest_completed_instruction_or_zero"</b> Like <code>"highest_completed_instruction"</code>
but if the job hasn't been started yet, or has completed successfully,
this sets the program_counter to its default, 0 so that the first
executed instruction will be the first instruction in the do_list.
Generally <code>"highest_completed_instruction_or_zero"</code> is more useful than
    <code>"highest_completed_instruction"</code>.
<br/>
<b id="Control.go_to_literal_doc_id">A literal object</b> The literal object can have up to three properites.
<ul><li><b>offset</b> Can be any one of the above instruction_locations.<br/>
    <i>Example</i>: <code>{offset: 12}</code>
    </li>
    <li><b>process</b> Describes how the offset is searched for. Note that since
      you may have more than one label with a given name, the order in which
      you traverse the do_list looking for such labels can matter. Possible values:
    <ul><li><b>forward</b> Search forward from the current location (default 0)
        for the location in the <code title="unEVALable code fragment">  offset</code>
        <i>Example</i>: <code>{offset: "label3", process: "forward"}</code>
        searches forward from the current location in the do_list to
        the first label or sync_point instruction named "label3".
        If it is not found, error.
        </li>
        <li><b>backward</b> Search backwards for the location of the offset. Error
        if not found.</li>
        <li><b>forward_then_backward</b> Search forward from the current location
        to the end of the do_list. If the offset is not found, search backwards from
        the current location. Error if not found. This is the default process.</li>
        <li><b>backward_then_forward</b> Search backward from the current location
            to the beginning of the do_list. If the offset is not found, search forwards from
            the current location. Error if not found.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>job</b> An instruction location can indicate a job of the described instruction.
    By default, that's the job that the go_to instruction is in. But you can
    tell another job to jump to a new instruction for its next instruction
    if you like. <br/>
    <i>Example</i>: <code>{job: "my_other_job", offset: "label3"}</code></li>
    </ul>
    <b>An array</b> There may not be a convenient "one shot" way to
    describe a location, however, by using two or more designators, you may
    better be able to describe it.<br/>
    <i>Examples</i>:<br/>
    <code>["myLabel", 1]</code> indicates the instruction immediately after "myLabel".<br/>
    <code>["myLabel", -1]</code> indicates the instruction immediately before "myLabel".<br/>
    <code>["program_counter", {offset: "sync_point", process: "backward"}]</code>
    Searches backwards from the program_counter to
    the first instruction of type "sync_point".
</ul>
Instruction_locations are also used in
initializing a Job's <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> program_counter</code> in defining the job, as well as
in calling a job's start method. The <code>Control.send_to_job</code> instruction
uses an instruction_location for identifying
where within the job to insert the given instruction as does the method
<code>Job.insert_instruction</code>.
<p></p>
    Much of the time that you'd be tempted to use a backwards
    Control.go_to,
    <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Control.loop_doc_id')">Control.loop</a> is better.
</details>

<details id="Control.if_any_errors_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>if_any_errors</summary>
    <code>Control.if_any_errors</code> checks to see if any of the supplied jobs have errored.
    If so, it inserts the supplied instruction into the do_list on the job
    that this instruction is on. In either case, <code>Control.if_any_errors</code> continues
    the job that its on.
    <i>Parameters</i><br/>
    <b>job_names</b> An array of strings of job names. If a named job doesn't exist, error.<br/>
    <b>instruction_if_error</b> Default: <code>Control.error()</code> An instruction that will be inserted into the do_list
    immediately after this instruction IF one of the named jobs has errored.
    The default for <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_if_error</code> is a function that
    inserts an instance of Control.error into the do_list of this job, causing it to error.
    The "reason" for that error instruction is explicit about the cause of the error.
    <p></p>
    Generally a job should be stopped quickly if there is an error.
    This instruction makes it easy to stop jobs that are concurrently cooperating
    with the current job. The instruction_if_error can be a function (called with the
    current job for "this") so that some arbitrary compensation can be made for the error.
</details>

<details id="Control.include_job_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>include_job</summary>
Inserts a do_list or a portion thereof into the current Job, right after this instruction.<br/>
The job_name parameter takes a wide variety of data to specify where to get a do_list from.
Most of those data formats are not actual Job names, but
they perform a similar role to a Job name in referencing a do_list to include.
<p></p>
Control.include_job has a large number of very specific error messages to help you correct mistakes.<br/>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
<b>job_name</b> Required. Indicates a do_list, which will be "clipped" by start_loc and end_loc.
    Formats:
    <ol><li><b>A Job instance</b>. <i>Example:</i> <code>Job.my_job</code><br/>
        The Job's orig_args.do_list is used. It doesn't matter if the included job has been run or not.</li>
        <li><b>An Array</b>.<br/>
         <i>Example:</i> <code>[[36000, 72000], [37000, 73000]]</code><br/>
            This can be an instructions array or a data array.
            It cannot be an oplet array.<br/>
             See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc(data_array_doc_id)">Data Array</a>.
        </li>
        <li><b>A String</b>. A variety of strings can be used. One advantage of using strings
            instead of Jobs or Arrays is that the string is resolved at instruction run-time
            whereas Job and Array are resolved at Job definition time. By delaying the
            resolution, you can place the definition that the string refers to
            AFTER the Job definition containing the <code>Control.include_job</code> instruction.
            String formats:
            <ul><li><b>Job.a_job_name</b> <i>Example:</i> <code>"Job.my_job"</code><br/>
                     This is the prefered way to reference a Job.
                     If a Job of that name is not defined when this instruction is run, error.
                </li>
                <li><b>a_job_name</b> <i>Example:</i> <code>"my_job"</code><br/>
                    A shortcut way to reference a job. More ambiguous than using the "Job." prefix.
                    If there is both a Job name and a variable of that same name, the Job name is used.
                </li>
                <li><b>a_variable_name</b> <i>Example:</i> <code>"foo"</code><br/>
                      The variable is expected to be bound to an array
                      of instructions. If a_variable_name is both a Job name and a global variable,
                      the Job name will be used.
                </li>
                <li><b>file_path</b></li> <i>Example:</i> <code>"my_job.dde"</code><br/>
                    Any string that isn't prefixed by "Job." but has a dot in it,
                    is considered to be a file_path.<br/>
                     A file path that doesn't start with a slash refers to a job in your "dde_apps" folder under
                    your "Documents" folder.<br/>
                    The file is evaluated. The result of the evaluation can be:<br/>
                    <ul><li><b>A Job</b> The Job used will be the <i>first</i> Job definition in the file.</li>
                        <li><b>A variable assignment</b> The first JavaScript code in the file should be<br/>
                            <code title="unEvalable">var some_name = [instr1, instr2, ...]</code><br/>
                             preceeded only by comments and whitespace, if any.
                        <br/>
                         <i>Example:</i><br/>
                          <code>var my_do_items = [[36000, 72000], [37000, 73000]]</code>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>An instructions array</b><br/><i>Example:</i>
                            <code>[[36000, 72000], [37000, 73000]]</code><br/>
                            The instructions array should be the <i>last</i> top-level expression in the file.
                            <span style="color:red;">Warning</span>: Sometimes the last top-level expression
                            is NOT returned, so its safer if the file contains only ONE top-level

<details id="Control.loop_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>loop</summary>
    <code>Control.loop</code> lets a Job repeat a sequence of instructions a number of times.
    This instruction is one of the most powerful and complex
    in DDE, providing a wide range of looping behavior.<br/>
    <i>Parameters</i> (2)<br/>
    <b>times_to_loop</b> Default: <code>2</code>. Determines the number of times that the body_fn is called,
    i.e. the iteration count of the loop. It can be one of five types:
    <p></p>
    <i>boolean</i><br/> If <code>false</code>, loop no times. This loop becomes a no-op.<br/>
    If <code>true</code>, loop forever, or until a <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Control.break_doc_id')">Control.break</a> instruction in the body_fn
    is executed. Like all arguments, this is evaluated at Job definition time to
    supply a value of a boolean (true or false).
    <p></p>
    <i>non-negative integer</i><br/> Number of times to call the body_fn. If <code>0</code>,
    the loop becomes a no-op, just like when this arg is <code>false</code>.
    This can be <code>Infinity</code> such that looping would only
    be limited by a <code>Control.break</code> instruction in the body_fn or
    stopping the Job.
    <p></p>
    <i>array</i><br/> The length of the array is the number of times to loop.
    If this arg is <code>[]</code> i.e. the empty array, this loop is a no-op
    just like a value of <code>false</code> or <code>0</code>.
    At each iteration, the iter_val will be a successive value in the array.
    The iter_index will be the index of each successive value in the array,
    taking on the values of 0 through array.length - 1.
    iter_total will be the length of the array.
    <p></p>
    <i>object</i><br/> The number of own properties of the object is the number
    of times to loop. At each iteration, the iter_key will be a property name in the object,
    and iter_val will be the property's value.
    <p></p>
    <i>function</i><br/> At the beginning of the first iteration, this function is
    called with the arguments of:
    <ul>
        <li>this=the_job_instance</li>
        <li>iter_index=<code>0</code></li>
        <li>iter_value=<code>undefined</code></li>
        <li>iter_total=<code>undefined</code></li>
        <li>iter_key=<code>undefined</code></li>
     </ul>
    If it returns a:
    <ul><li>non-neg-integer: Used for the rest of this loop.</li>
        <li>array: Used for the rest of this loop.</li>
        <li>object: Used for the rest of this loop.</li>
        <li>boolean: The function is called upon every iteration to determine if
    looping should stop or not. If <code>false</code> is returned,
    no looping occurs, this loop is a no-op. If <code>true</code> is returned,
    that "true" is used for the first iteration, and the function is called
    at the beginning of every subsequent iteration until <code>false</code>
    is returned or the body_fn executes a <code>Control.break</code> instruction.</li>
    </ul>
    You want to use a function here instead of directly using a boolean, non-neg-integer,
    or array, when you want those values to be computed at the time
    the Control.loop instruction is executed as opposed to Job definition time.
    <p></p>
    <b>body_fn</b> This function is called with basically the same args as
    are used to call times_to_loop when it is a function.<br/>
    <ol>
        <li>this=the_job_instance</li>
        <li>iter_index= a non negative integer of the iteration number i.e. 0, 1, 2, etc.</li>
        <li>iter_val If times_to_loop is:
           <ul><li> true: So is this arg.</li>
               <li> integer: This arg is the same as iter_index</li>

            is an object (or a function that returns one), in which case
            iter_key is the property name of the property being looped
            through for this iteration.<br/>
             Note that the order that the properties
            are used in looping is strictly speaking indeterminant as JS does not
            specify an order to object properties. However, we've found that
            the order of string-named properties are usually the order in
            which they were added to the object. <br/>
            Beware: If you have created the object with number keys, i.e.
            <code>{6:"some val"}</code>,
            the iter_key will be a string: <code>"6"</code> not
            a number <code>6</code> and generally appear before normal string-named keys.
            Its best if you don't depend on an ordering of the properties.</li>
    </ol>
    Loop instructions may be nested. <code>Control.break</code> instructions will
    end the inner-most loop that contains the <code>Control.break</code>.

<details id="Control.start_job_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>start_job</summary>
 <code>Control.start_job</code> starts another job.<br/>
 <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
 <b>job_name</b> Required. Can be:
 <ul><li>An instance of the Job to start.</li>
    <li>A string starting with "Job." followed by the Job's name.</li>
    <li>A string of the Job's name.</li>
 </ul>
 <b>start_options</b> A literal object. Name-value pairs that can
 be passed when creating a new Job can also be passed to a job's <i>start</i> method and
 are done so when a Job starts another Job.<br/>
 <i>Example</i>: <code>{program_counter: 2}</code> <br/>
    causes the job to be started, executing its 3rd do_list item first.<br/>
 <b>if_started</b> A string. Says what to do if the job that
 is to be started has a status of <code>"running"</code> or <code>"waiting"</code>.
 Valid values for this argument are:
 <ul><li><code>"ignore"</code> Don't start the job. Just do nothing. This is the default.</li>
     <li><code>"error"</code> Stop the job running this instruction with an error.</li>
     <li><code>"restart"</code> Stop and restart the job named by <b>job_name</b>.</li>
</ul>

If the status of the job to be started is:
    <ul><li><code>"starting"</code>, this instruction is ignored.</li>
        <li><code>"suspended"</code> The job is unsuspended.</li>
        <li><code>"not_started"</code>, <code>"completed"</code>, <code>"errored"</code>, or <code>"interrupted"</code>,
                    the job is started.</li>
        <li><code>"running"</code> or <code>"waiting"</code>, then what happens depends on the
                value of the <b>if_started</b> argument.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>wait_until_job_done</b> Boolean. Default: <code>false</code>
    If the value of this argument is <code>false</code>, start_job behaves
    as documented above. However if it is <code>true</code>,
    generally this instruction will wait until the Job named in job_name
    is completed before proceeding to the next instruction.
    Thus, a <code>false</code> value is good for running the job_name in
    parallel, whereas <code>true</code> is good for running it in serial.
    You might, for instance have a "master Job" that starts off a whole
    slew of other jobs. Whether those jobs run in serial or parallel
    depends on the setting of wait_until_job_done.<br/>
    <i>The Details</i><br/>
    When wait_until_job_done=true, the <b>if_started</b> argument is ignored.<br/>
    The exact behavior of wait_until_job_done=true depends on the
    status of the job_name job. If it is:
    <ul>
        <li><b>not_started</b> Start the job_name job and wait for it to complete.</li>
        <li><b>starting, running, waiting</b> wait for the job_name job to complete.</li>
        <li><b>suspended</b> Unsuspend the job_name job and wait for it to complete.</li>
        <li><b>completed</b> Continue on with this job.</li>
        <li><b>errored</b> This job errors and stops.</li>
        <li><b>interrupted</b> This job is interrupted and stops.</li>
    </ul>
    <i>Examples:</i><br/>
    job2 starts job1. job2 does not wait for job1 to complete before running its next instruction,
    if any.

<details id="Control.stop_job_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>stop_job</summary>
  Causes the indicated job to stop just before executing a particular instruction.<br/>
  <i>Parameters</i>:<br/>
  <b>instruction_location</b> Optional. Determines the job to stop and the instruction within that
  job that it should stop before executing. If <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_location</code> does
  not indicate a job, then the job that this instruction is in will be stopped.
  If <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_location</code> is not given, then
  the offset will be <code>"program_counter"</code>, i.e. the job will
  stop before executing its next instruction. Thus the default is that
  the current job will be stopped immediately.
  See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Control.go_to_doc_id', event)">Control.go_to</a> for details
  on the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_location</code> format.<br/>
  <b>reason</b> A string. The reason that the job is being told to stop.<br/>
  <b>perform_when_stopped</b> A boolean. When <code>false</code> (the default)
  the job will behave as if its 'when_stopped' parameter is <code>"stop"</code>,
  i.e. the job will end. When <code>true</code>, the job's when_stopped action will
  be performed.<br/>
  Example:<code>Control.stop_job({job: "my_job", offset: "label1"})</code>
  <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job</code> will stop when it reaches the instruction named "label1".
</details>

<details id="Control.suspend_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>suspend</summary>
  Causes the indicated job to pause. It will not execute any more of its instructions
  until it is unsuspended. <br/>
  <i>Parameters:</i> <br/>
  <b>job_name</b> Default: <code>null</code>
  The job to be suspended. <code>null</code> means suspend the job that
  this instruction is in. A string means suspend the job with that name.
  May also be a job_instance to suspend.<br/>
  <b>reason</b> Default: <code>""</code>. A string of why the job is suspended.<br/>
  <i>Example:</i>
  <code>Control.suspend()</code>.<br/>
  Suspends the current job for no reason.
</details>

<details id="Control.unsuspend_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>unsuspend</summary>
Unsuspends a suspended job. If the job to be suspended is not suspended,
no action will be taken. Note that a job cannot unsuspend itself,
because it is not running.
<i>Parameters:</i> <br/>
<b>job_name</b> Default: <code>"required"</code>
The job name or job instance to be unsuspended.
<b>stop_reason</b> Default: <code>false</code> If false, the job is unsuspended.
   If a string, the job is stopped, with the reason of this stop_reason.
<p></p>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<code>Control.suspend("my_job")</code> <p></p>
<b>unsuspend</b> is also a method on a job.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job.unsuspend()</code>.<br/>
This causes the job to resume from a suspension. You can call it
from any JavaScript code such as in a function that's a do_list item.
The method takes 1 arg, "stop_reason" that behaves as documented above.
</details>


<details id="Control.sync_point_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>sync_point</summary>
  A sync_point instruction causes all running jobs with the same-named sync_point
  to pause until they all reach the sync_point. Once that happens, they
  are all allowed to proceed executing their instructions.<br/>
  <i>Parameters</i><br/>
  <b>name</b> The name of the sync point. Must be identical with other sync points
              that you expect to be in-sync. There should only be one sync_point
              with a given name in a job.<br/>
  <b>job_names</b> An array of job names containing same_named sync points that
    you want to all pause at the same place. A sync_point instruction may
    contain the name of the job its in. Effectly that doesn't matter,
    but does allow all the same-named sync points to have the same list of job_names.<br/>
    Example: <code>Control.sync_point("midway", ["job_one", "job_two"])</code><br/>
   <p></p>
   If a sync point instruction has no job names, or only its own job name,
   it will not wait but rather breeze right through its sync_point.
   <p></p>
   By having different job_names, you can configure a sync_point in one job
   to wait for the other job's sync point to be reached, yet <i>not</i> have
   the other job wait for the first job. Any combination of such lop-sided
   waits can be set up amongst jobs with same-named sync_points for
   a lot of flexibility. This can increase the overall speed of a cooperating
   robot group over merely "all pause at each same-named sync_points" 
   because it allows those jobs that <i>can</i> proceed to do so.

<details id="Control.send_to_job_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>send_to_job</summary>
<code>Control.send_to_job</code> inserts instructions into another job's do_list. It can also
start, unsuspend and grab data from another job. <code>Control.send_to_job</code> is complex, powerful,
and rarely used. Example: <pre>
Control.send_to_job({do_list_item: Dexter.move_to([0, 0.5, 0.075]),
                   where_to_insert: "end",
                   unsuspend: true,
                   wait_until_done: true})</pre>
<i>Parameters:</i><ul>
<li><b>do_list_item</b> An instruction or array of instructions to insert into the to_job.</li>
<li><b>where_to_insert</b> The location in the do_list of the to_job to insert the do_list_item.
  The full list of instruction_locations for <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> where_to_insert</code>
  can be seen in the documentation for the
  <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Control.go_to_doc_id', event)">Control.go_to</a> instruction.
  Particularly useful ones for send_to_job are:<br/>
  <ul><li><code>{job: "other_job", offset: "next_top_level"}</code> Inserts the do_list_item
  after the program_counter and just before the next original (top level) do_list item
  in the referenced job.
  If a function do_list item in to_job returns an array of instructions,
  this ensures that the inserted do_list_item will not go in the middle of such instructions.
  Thus if the instructions from the function must be executed as a continuous group, 
  "next_top_level" is a safe place to insert additional do_list items.</li>
    <li><code>"after_program_counter"</code> Immediately after the destination job's program_counter.
    Not as safe as "next_top_level".</li>
    <li><code>"end"</code> At the very end of the do_list. With no job designator,
    this will extend the current job's do_list by one new instruction on the end.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
 <li><b>wait_until_done</b> (default false) If true, the from_job will wait until the to_job
    executes its newly inserted instructions.</li> 
 <li><b>start</b> (default false) If true, and the to_job has yet to be started,
    it will be started after the do_list_item is inserted into its do_list.
    <p></p>
    If a job has yet to be started and you send instructions to it, those
    instructions will be stored in a special place until the job is started.
    During the start process, after the do_list is made but before the
    initial_instruction (if any) is prepended to the do_list,
    the sent instructions will be inserted into the do_list at
    the location specified in 'where_to_insert'. These instructions will
    be used for that initial running of the job only. Even if the job is running
    at the time its sent instructions, they will only run in that running of the job.
    They will not be present if you restart the job. Restarating the job uses
    the do_list defined for the job only.
 </li>
 <li><b>unsuspend</b> (default false) If true, and the to_job is suspended,
     the to_job will be unsuspended after the do_list_item is inserted into its do_list.</li> 
 <li><b>status_variable_name</b> The name of a field placed in the user_data of the from_job.
     It is initialized to <code>"sent"</code>. When the inserted do_list_item has been executed,
     this field is set to <code>"done"</code>. </li> 
  <li><b>other variable names</b> If a parameter to send_to_job is not one of the above,
    it is assumed to be the name of a field to create in the user_data of the to_job.
    "Other variable names" have a value of a function. After the do_list_item is executed,
    the function for each of the other varible names is called within the to_job and
    the returned value is set to its corresponding other variable name in the 
    user_data of the from_job. This allows the from_job to get data from the to_job
    immediately after the do_list_item is run. </li>
 </ul>
 To achieve the same effect of send_to_job, see documention on the method
    <code>Job.insert_instruction</code>.
</details> <!-- end send_to_job -->

<!-- obsoleted by initial_instruction and insert_instruction <details id="Control.sent_from_job_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>sent_from_job</summary>
This instruction is typically not created by users directly. send_to_job creates
such an instruction and places it on the to_job as a container for the newly inserted
instructions. However, if you want to extend the do_list of a job when starting it,
you can pass an instance of <code>sent_from_job</code> as an option
of start. This will insert the new instruction(s) just before the job is started.
Example:<pre>Job.j8.start({sent_from_job: Control.sent_from_job(
          {do_list_item: function(){out("special insert")},
           where_to_insert: "sp1"})})
</pre>
<b>do_list_item</b> can be a single instruction or an array of instructions.<br/>
<b>where_to_insert</b> See doc for send_to_job<br/>
The inserted instructions will not be present if, after running the job,
you call start with no argument.
</details> --> <!-- end sent_from_job -->

<details id="Control.wait_until_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>wait_until</summary>
This instruction causes a job to pause until the supplied condition is met.<br/>
Example:<code>Control.wait_until(2)</code><br/>
<i>Parameter:</i><br/>
<b>fn_date_dur</b> Default: <code>1</code> This argument can be one of:
<ul><li><b>an integer</b> The number of seconds for the wait. </li>
    <li><b>a Duration instance</b> The amount of time for the wait. </li>
    <li><b>a Date instance</b> Causes a wait until the JavaScript date occurs.
         Careful, you can easily cause a job to wait for years!</li>
    <li><b>a function</b> The function is called at each do_loop iteration.
          The function's return value is used in a JavaScript <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> if</code> statement.
          false, undefined, null, 0, NaN, or the empty string ("") are considered to be false.
          Anything else is considered to be true and the wait will be over.
          The function is called with a <code>this</code> of the current job,
          so you can access the entire job's state when determining whether
          or not to return <code>true</code>.
    </li>
    <li><b>a Job Instance</b> Waits until the passed in Job instance completes.
          If the passed in Job Instance, errors or is interrupted then
         then this job also errors or is interrupted.
    </li>
    <li><b>"new_instruction"</b> Causes a wait_until instruction to be added
    just below this instruction on the do_list. If this is the last instruction
    on the do_list, then this job waits until a new instruction is added on the
    end of a do list.<br/>
    <i>Example</i>:<pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite"> new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [IO.out("first instruction"),
                   Control.wait_until("new_instruction")]})
    </code></pre>
        Evaling <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job.start()</code><br/>
        causes "first instruction" to be printed out, then the
        job pauses until an instruction is inserted into the do_list right after this "wait_until" instruction.<pre>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.insert_instruction(IO.out("the end"),
                       {job: "my_job",
                        offset: "after_program_counter"})</code></pre>
        Causes wait_until to stop waiting, "the end" is printed and the job completes successfully.<br/>
        If instead of that argument to <code>Job.insert_instruction</code>, we had instead used:<pre>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.insert_instruction([IO.out("the middle"),
                        Control.wait_until("new_instruction")],
                        {job: "my_job",
                         offset: "after_program_counter"})</code></pre>
        then each time we eval that code, it prints "the middle" and
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job</code> pauses again.
        We can end the pause by inserting an instruction after the program counter
        that doesn't contain a wait_until,
        such as our first call to <code>Job.insert_instruction</code> above.
    </li>
    <li><b>instruction_location</b> <i>Only applies to instruction_locations that
         are arrays or literal objects.</i> Waits for the instruction location
         to refer to a program_counter that is less than or equal to
         the program_counter in the job referenced by the instruction_location.
         This instruction waits until a job gets to a certain instruction.
         This performs like a one_sided <code>Control.sync_point</code> instruction
         where the job this instruction is in will wait for the job
         specified in the instruction_location, but not the other way around.
         Its advantage over <code>Control.sync_point</code> is that you don't have
         to have a Control.sync_point instruction in the job you're waiting for.
         Thus you can wait for a job reaching one of its instructions
         that never expected it to be waited for.<br/>
         Warning: If the instruction_location specifies the job
         that this <code>Control.wait_until</code> instruction is in, or lets the instruction_location
         default to that, this job could wait for itself and thus forever.</li>

    <details id="IO.grab_robot_status_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>grab_robot_status</summary>
        robot_status is an array that holds data from the robot, along with aspects of the instruction
        that was sent to the robot to capture that data. This array is the value of the robot
        instance field <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> robot_status</code>. <p></p>
        The instruction: <code>IO.grab_robot_status()</code> provides an easy way to get values out of that array
        and made available for other instructions to use.<br/>
        <i>Parameters</i><br/>
        <b>user_data_variable</b> Default: <code>"grabbed_robot_status"</code> A string (required) of the name of the job's
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> user_data</code> variable to shove the grabbed
        robot_status data into. If there is already such a variable,
        its value is over-written. If not, it is created and intialized
        with the new value.
        <p></p>
        After this instruction is run, the grabbed value
        is available globally Job.the_job_name.user_data.the_val_of_this_arg.<br/>
        For instance, if this job is named "my_job" and the value of
        user_data_variable is "my_var" then:
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.my_job.user_data.my_var</code>
        But inside another instruction that is defined as a function,
        <code>this</code> will be bound to the current job instance so:
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this.user_data.my_var</code> will access the grabbed data.<br/>

        <b>start_index</b> A non-negative integer signifying the
        first data item to extract from the robot_status array.
        Its default value is the value of <code>Serial.DATA0</code>
        Another normal value would be <code>Dexter.J1_ANGLE</code>
        See below for a comprehensive list.
        <br/>
        <i>Special values:</i><br/>
        <code>"all"</code> The entire 60 element robot_status
        array is used. The value of end_index is ignored.<br/>
        <code>"data_array"</code> The part of the robot_status array after
        the header information is used. For Serial robots, this will be just
        the data returned by the serial port. For Dexter robots, this
        will be the data about Dexter's joint angles, etc.
        The value of end_index is ignored.<br/>
        <b>end_index</b> A non-negative integer signifying the last element of the
        robot_status array to extract. The default value is <code>null</code>.
        If this value is null or not passed, only the data at the start_index
        is used. The value stored in the user_data variable will NOT be an array,
        just that one element.<br/>
        <i>Special value</i> <code>"end"</code> The portion of the robot_status
        from start_index through the end of the robot_status array is extracted.
        <p></p>
        If both the start_index and end_index are not passed,
        then the value will be: For a Serial robot, the first "item"
        returned from the serial port in response to a send.
        For Dexter, it will be DMA_READ_DATA.
        <p></p>
        You can use some constants for the values of start_index and end_index.<br/>
        For a Dexter robot these are: <br/>
        <code>Dexter.JOB_ID</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.INSTRUCTION_ID</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.START_TIME</code> //ms since jan 1, 1970 from Dexter's clock<br/>
        <code>Dexter.STOP_TIME</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.INSTRUCTION_TYPE</code> //a letter signifying the instruction type.<br/>
        <br/>
        <code>Dexter.ERROR_CODE</code> //0 means no error.<br/>
        <code>Dexter.RECORD_BLOCK_SIZE</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.END_EFFECTOR_IN</code><br/>
        <br/>
        <code>Dexter.J6_MEASURED_ANGLE</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.J6_MEASURED_TORQUE</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.J7_MEASURED_ANGLE</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.J7_MEASURED_TORQUE</code><br/>
        and, for J1 through J5,
        <br/>
        <code>Dexter.J1_ANGLE</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.J1_DELTA</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.J1_PID_DELTA</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.J1_A2D_SIN</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.J1_A2D_COS</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.J1_MEASURED_ANGLE</code><br/>
        <code>Dexter.J1_SENT</code><br/>

        <p></p>
        For a Serial robot these are:<br/>
        <code>Serial.JOB_ID</code><br/>
        <code>Serial.INSTRUCTION_ID</code><br/>
        <code>Serial.START_TIME</code>          // ms since jan 1, 1970 from Dexter's clock<br/>
        <code>Serial.STOP_TIME</code>          // ms since jan 1, 1970 from Dexter's clock<br/>
        <code>Serial.INSTRUCTION_TYPE</code>   // A letter indicating the instruction type<br/>

        <code>Serial.ERROR_CODE</code>          // means no error.<br/>
        <code>Serial.DATA0</code>               // data coming back from the board<br/>
        <code>Serial.DATA1</code><br/>
        <code>Serial.DATA2</code><br/>
        <code>Serial.DATA3</code><br/>
        <code>Serial.DATA4</code><br/>
        <code>Serial.DATA5</code><br/>
        <code>Serial.DATA6</code><br/>
        <code>Serial.DATA7</code><br/>
        <code>Serial.DATA8</code><br/>
        <code>Serial.DATA9</code><br/>
        <br/>

        In order to insure that the Dexter robot_status array is up to date,
        you should place <code>Dexter.get_robot_status()</code> in your do_list before
        the grab_robot_status instruction.<br/>
        <i>Examples of 2 adjacent instructions on a job's do_list:</i><br/>

        <code>Dexter.get_robot_status()</code><br/>
        <code>IO.grab_robot_status("my_zero_data", Serial.DATA0) </code><br/>
        grab_robot_status can be called with a subject of a job instance in place
        of <code>Robot</code> like so:<br/>
        <code> Robot.dexter0.grab_robot_status("my_user_data_var")</code>
        <p></p>
        See Job Example: <i>Serial Port</i> for an extended example.
    </details> <!-- end grab_robot_status -->

    <details id="IO.out_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>out</summary>
        Very similar to the function <code>out</code> but made for use as a robot instruction.
        Prints a message to the Output pane in the color of your choice.
        This is the "print statement" as an instruction, so useful in debugging.<p></p>
        <i>Example:</i><br/>
        <code>IO.out("hey " + 345, "green")</code><p></p>
        <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
        <b>val</b> Any JavaScript data. Most commonly this is a string, but
        can be a number, an array etc.<br/>
        <b>color</b> A string representing a color. Default "black". Can
        be any string in the <b>color</b> series, or have the format:<br/>
        <code>"rgb(255, 100, 0)"</code>.<br/>
        <b>temp</b> Default: <code>false</code>. With the default, printed output stays in the
        Output pane until DDE is relaunched.
        <p></p>
        If temp is <code>true</code>,
        then <b>val</b> is still printed in the Output pane, but is over-ridden
        by subsequence calls to out with temp == true. Calls to out with temp == false
        will erase any "temp" output.
        <p></p>
        If temp is a string, then out prints <b>val</b> similarly to temp == true in that
        the previous call to out with that temp string will be over-ridden in place.
        However, when another call to out with a different value for temp occurs,
        the output of out with a temp string will <i>not</i> be erased.
        Thus the last call to out with a given temp string remains in the Output pane,
        in its place, regardless of other out calls.
        <p></p>
        Unlike an instruction such as:<br/>
        <code>function(){out("The status is: " + this.status_code)}</code><br/>
        IO.out cannot access its job instance, but it does print out
        its job name and instruction ID right before printing <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> val</code>.

    <details id="IO.show_picture_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>show_picture</summary>
    This instruction takes the same arguments and has the same functionality as the method
    <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Picture.show_picture_doc_id')">Picture.show_picture</a>
    except that it doesn't take a callback argument.<br/>
    <i>Example:</i>
        <pre><code>new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [IO.show_picture()]})
      </code></pre>
    </details>
    <details id="IO.show_video_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>show_video</summary>
        This instruction takes the same arguments and has the same functionality as the method
        <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Picture.show_video_doc_id')">Picture.show_video</a>
        except that it doesn't take a callback argument.<br/>
        <i>Example:</i>
        <pre><code>new Job({name: "my_job",
     do_list: [IO.show_video()]})
      </code></pre>
    </details>
    <details id="IO.take_picture_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>take_picture</summary>
        This instruction takes the same arguments and has similar functionality as the method
        <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Picture.take_picture_doc_id')">Picture.take_picture</a>
        except that it doesn't take a <b>camera_id</b> argument.
        It does take a callback argument.
        The next instruction is run after the callback returns, providing
        the callback doesn't take too long, so keep callback computation fairly short
        if your next instruction depends on the callback being completed.
        <p></p>
        The callback is called with <code>this</code> bound to the job
        that this instruction is running in.<br/>
        If the callback is a string, it is considered to be the name of
        a user_data variable that you want to set to the mat created
        with take_picture. You can then use this mat in further instructions.
        <br/>
        <i>Example:</i>
        <pre><code>new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list: [IO.take_picture({callback: "my_pic"})]})
  </code></pre>
        <code>Job.my_job.user_data.my_pic</code><br/>
        returns the mat.

<details id="Brain_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Brain</summary>
<b>Brain</b> is a virtual robot used to manage other robots or do purely software tasks.
It has no special instructions of its own, but can use Control, Human, IO and the
miscellaneous Robot instructions (function definitions, etc),
just like all the other robots.
<p></p>
</details> <!-- End Brain -->

<details id="Dexter_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Dexter</summary>
Dexter can perform instructions that command it to move. After it does
an instruction, it sends back information from its sensors confirming where it has moved
and additional data. This data can be used in subsequent instructions to both verify
Dexter's position as well as respond to forces on the arm and other sensor data.
<p></p>
An instance of Dexter is created like so:
<pre><code title="not in TestSuite"> new Dexter({name: "my_dex",
            simulate: true
           })</code></pre>
<p></p>
<!--Multiple jobs may use a given robot instance as their robot. It is up to the programmer
to make sure such jobs don't screw each other up. You may not have more than one
active robot with the same name or ip_address.-->
It is recommended that each job have their own robot.
<p></p>
The default robot is <code>Robot.dexter0</code>. This is created in your dde_apps/dde_init.js file.
Set dexter0's <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> ip_address</code> and
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> port</code> in that file.
We recommend allowing dexter0's simulate param to default to <code>null</code> so that
it can take advantage of the Misc pane header's  simulate radio buttons.
<p></p>
If you are using DDE to control zero or one Dexter, just use dexter0. No need
to create your own Robot instance.

<details id="new_dexter_parameters_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>new Dexter parameters</summary>
The parameters used to define an instance of Dexter are:
<ul>
    <li id="dexter_param_name_doc_id"><b>name</b> Any string, but must be unique across all robots.
    The instance of the robot is stored in
    <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Robot.the_name</code></li>
    <li id="dexter_param_simulate_doc_id"><b>simulate</b> Possible values:
         <ul>
             <li><b>true</b> Instructions will not be sent to the Dexter robot but rather
               to DDE's Dexter simulator, showing an image of Dexter in DDE's "Sim" pane.</li>
             <li> <b>false</b> Instructions will only be sent to the ip_address and port

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Dexter Instructions</summary>
All of the Dexter instructions can take a Dexter instance i.e. <code>Robot.dexter0</code>
as a subject to the call. That will direct the instruction to that Dexter.
The subject in an instruction call can also be the Dexter class, i.e. <code>Dexter</code>
in which case the instruction will go to the robot of the job. This is the
normal case.<br/>
This makes it easy for one job to control multiple robots and for
one job to just use one <i>default</i> robot as is most common.<br/>
<i>Examples</i> of instructions in a Job's do_list:
<pre><code>
  Dexter.move_all_joints([30, 40])
  Robot.dexter0.move_all_joints([30, 40])
</code></pre>

<details id="data_array_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Data Array</summary>
Do_lists for Jobs with a Dexter Robot can be of 4 different kinds.
<ol>
<li><b>oplet array</b> An array containing a prefix of meta-information, an oplet,
and arguments for that oplet.
</li>
<li><b>empty array</b> An array containing potentially other arrays of any nested depth,
but with no "leaf" values. Such arrays are "no-ops" meaning they are just thrown out.
Sometimes they are accidently automatically generated by filtering code that
filters out all useful instructions. Throwing out empty arrays simplifies
writing functions that create instructions arrays.
</li>
<li><b>instructions array</b> An array of instructions nested to any depth.
Such arrays are usually "automatically flattened" before their leaf instructions
are added to the do_list.
</li>
<li><b>data array</b> An array that is not one of the above types.
The "running" of a data array instruction consists of its elements
being passed as arguments to their Job's <i>data_array_transformer</i> function.
Whatever this function returns is put on the do_list.
It may return null or an empty array, thus "filtering out" that
data array instruction.
<p></p>
A data_array_transformer may also be an oplet, in which case
that oplet and the elements of the data array are passed to
<a href="#" onclick="open_doc(make_ins_doc_id)">make_ins</a>,
whose return value is placed on the do_list.
The default data_array_transformer is <code>"P"</code>,
creating effectively a pid_move_all_joints instruction.
</li>
</ol>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<pre><code>
new Job({name: "my_t_job",
         data_array_transformer: "a",
         do_list: [
                    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                    [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
                  ]})
    </code></pre>
This Job has an effective do_list of:<br/>
<code>[Dexter.move_all_joints(0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
 Dexter.move_all_joints(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)]
</code><br/>
because <code>"a"</code> is the oplet for Dexter.move_all_joints.
</details>

<details id="Dexter_instruction_string_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Instruction String</summary>
A string on the do_list is interpreted as a string to be sent to Dexter.
The first character of the string should be a Dexter "oplet", such as
"a" for Dexter.move_all_joints, or "P" for Dexter.pid_move_all_joints.
Following that should be a space, and the arguments to that oplet,
separated by a space.
The string should end in a semicolon.
<p></p>
Before the string is sent to Dexter, it is given a prefix of values for:<br/>
<code title="unEVALable">job_id instruction_id start_time stop_time </code>.<br/>
Example of the whole string sent to Dexter for move_all_joints functionality:<br/>
<samp>1 37 1554079143946 undefined a 0 36000 72000;</samp>
If the original string supplied in the do_list does not end in a semicolon, it is given one
before being sent to Dexter.
<p></p>
Note that this is similar to a
<a href="#" onclick="open_doc(make_ins_doc_id)">make_ins</a> instruction,
except that the arguments are not converted, but passed as indicated in the string.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.calibrate_build_tables_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>calibrate_build_tables</summary>
This instruction sets lots of parameters on Dexter and causes it to move twice,
which calibrates the optical encoders of each joint.
Unlike the Jobs menu/Calibrate Dexter, no user interface is required.
When this instruction is complete, it sets the
Dexter's <i>is_calibrated</i> property to <code>true</code>.<br/>
<i>Parameters:</i> passed by keyword: <br/>
<b>J_move_max</b> Default: <code>[180, 100, 165, 110, 180]</code>
    The maximum angles in degrees that Dexter will move to

<i>Parameters:</i> None.<br/>
A Dexter robot has an <i>instruction queue</i> which contains instructions that have been sent from
DDE but not yet executed. As soon as Dexter recieves an instruction from DDE, it typically acknowledges receipt
to DDE,
which causes DDE to send the next instruction in the Job's do_list.
A <code>Dexter.empty_instruction_queue</code> instruction changes that behavior and causes all the instructions in the
queue to be executed before DDE attempts to run another instruction on the do_list.

<i>Parameters:</i> None.<br/>
A Dexter robot has an <i>instruction queue</i> which contains instructions that have been sent from
DDE but not yet executed. As soon as Dexter recieves an instruction from DDE, it typically acknowledges receipt
to DDE,
which causes DDE to send the next instruction in the Job's do_list.
An <code>Dexter.empty_instruction_queue_immediately</code> instruction removes all the
instructions from the instruction queue
without executing them. It then informs DDE to send the next instruction.
This is an unusual instruction as it implies that the instructions sent to Dexter were in error.
You might want to do this in an emergency situation or if the environment unexpectedly changes.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.get_robot_status_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>get_robot_status</summary>
<i>Paramenters:</i> None<br/>
Retrieves lots of information from Dexter. This is placed in an array that becomes the value of
the job's robot's <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> robot_status</code> field, and, if the job's
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> keep_history</code> is true, gets pushed onto the
job's <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> rs_history</code> array.
<p></p>
<i>Examples</i>:
<code>Dexter.get_robot_status()</code>  //how this should look on  job's do list.<br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.j1.robot.robot_status</code>  //getting the whole status array after the above instruction is run.<br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Job.j1.robot.robot_status[Dexter.J1_ANGLE]</code> //returns the angle of Joint 1, in arcseconds
<p></p>
This instruction blocks further processing of the job's do_list instructions until
all of the instructions on Dexter's instruction_queue are executed.
<p></p>
See also the instruction: <code>Control.grab_robot_status</code>
</details>

<details id="Dexter.get_robot_status_immediately_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>get_robot_status_immediately</summary>
<i>Paramenters:</i> None<br/>
Retrieves lots of information from Dexter. This is placed in an array that becomes the value of
the job's <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> robot_status</code> field, but is not placed on the job's
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> rs_history</code> array.
<p></p>
Unlike <code>Dexter.get_robot_status</code>, this instruction causes Dexter to return its data immediately,
before any of the instructions on its <i>instruction queue</i> are executed.
</details>

<details id="make_ins_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>make_ins</summary>
    Normally you should make instructions for Dexter using one of the high level method calls,
    ie <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code>. However, we provide the function <code>make_ins</code>,
    useful in some low level situations. The first argument is the instruction type, (nickname: "oplet")
    a single letter string such as "a". The remaining arguments are whatever that instruction type
    accepts. Example:<br/>
    <code>make_ins("a", 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5)</code> =>
    <samp>[undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, "a", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</samp>
    creates an instruction that moves the 5 joints
    by 1, through 5 degrees respectively.
    If you have the arguments in an array, you can use this syntax:<br/>
    <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> make_ins("a", ...my_array)</code>
    <p></p>
    If the last argument passed in a make_ins call is a Dexter robot instance,
    the instruction will be sent to that Dexter.
    <p></p>
    The returned value is an array that has its first several fields empty. DDE uses them
    for storing the job_id, instruction_id and some timing information.
</details> <!-- end make_ins -->

<details id="Dexter.move_all_joints_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_all_joints</summary>
move_all_joints is a lower level instruction than move_to, giving you the ability to dicate
the angle of each of Dexter's 5 main joints, J1 through J5
as well as the two "end effector" joints J6 and J7. A joint's angle is specified in degrees.
The min and max angles of each joint are in constants: <br/>
    <code>Dexter.J1_ANGLE_MIN</code> and
    <code>Dexter.J1_ANGLE_MAX</code><br/>
through <code>Dexter.J5_ANGLE_MIN</code>
and     <code>Dexter.J5_ANGLE_MAX</code>,<br/>
all included in the series <b>Dexter_constant</b>.
Examples:<br/>
<code>Dexter.move_all_joints([15, NaN, 30])</code><br/>
You can pass in an array of up to 7 long, each indicating the
degrees you want the corresponding joint to move to.<br/>
<code>NaN</code> or the lack of enough numbers means keep the angle for that joint what the
last instruction run in a Job set it to.
<p></p>
If a joint angle is passed in as an array of one number, that number will
be used as the "relative" degrees to add to the current joint angle.
So for instance, if the previous move_all_joints instruction
for j1 indicated <code>30</code>,
and the next move_all_joints command for j1 indicated <code>[5]</code>, then
j1 would be moved to 35 degrees. The syntax of using a number wrapped in an array
can be used for any joint of any move joints instruction.
It can also be used for the x, y, and z positions of any move_to instruction.

</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_all_joints_relative_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_all_joints_relative</summary>
Similar to <code>Dexter.move_all_joints</code> except that the joint angles
are not used absolutely, but are added to the previous angles
indicated by the last DDE Dexter move instruction.
Note that this "base" that is added to is not literally the output of Dexter's optical sensors
for joint position, but rather where the robot was <i>told</i> to go in its last move instruction
in a Job.
<p></p>
A <code>NaN</code> or missing angle default to 0, meaning
move 0 degrees relative to the last value given for that joint<br/>
<i>Example</i>:<br/>
<code>Dexter.move_all_joints_relative([15, 15])</code><br/>
tells the Job's robot to move joints 1 and 2 to
an angle that is 15 degrees <i>more</i> than it is currently at.
Joints 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 stay the same.
<p></p>
Note that the syntax used for move_all_joints to declare that an
individual joint angle is relavtive (i.e. wrapping it in square brackets) cannot be used for
move_all_joints_relative, as those joint angles are already relative.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_home_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_home</summary>
Moves all joints to 0. J1 is facing forwards, J2, J3, J4 are straight up. J5 
causes Link 5 to be horizontal pointing forwards.
Example: <code>Dexter.move_home()</code>
</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_to_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_to</summary>
        This instruction commands Dexter to move from where ever it is, to position its
        end effector at the given x, y, z location. It is complicated by the fact that
        usually there is more than one configuration of Dexter's joints that
        can achieve that position and that Dexter is inherently limited by the
        lengths of its links.<br/>
        <i>Parameters</i><br/>
        <b>xyz</b> tells Dexter to position its end effector to a position.
        An array of 3 numbers, each indicating meters from the position 0, 0, 0
        which is at the center of the base of Dexter, in its surface (think table) plane.
        Imagine yourself as Dexter facing forwards. <br/>
        The <b>X axis</b> is to your left and right
        with left being negative and right being positive.<br/>
        The valid range is from <br/>
        -0.747804 to 0.747804. <br/>
        The <b>Y axis</b> runs from behind you to in front of you with
        negative behind you and positive in front of you.<br/>
        The valid range is from<br/>
         -0.747804 to 0.747804.<br/>
        The <b>Z axis</b> is vertical with the table surface at 0,
        below the surface being negative and above the surface being positive.<br/>
        The valid range is from <br/>
        -0.582704 to 0.912904.
        <p></p> If an x, y, or z argument is wrapped in an array, ie <code>[0.1]</code>
        it means move the robot that number of meters relative to where it was told to
        go in the last move command.
        <p></p>
        The J5_direction parameter also affects reachability.
        <p></p>
        <b>J5_direction</b> indicates the direction you want the end effector to be pointing.
        This is usually an array of 3 numbers (each ranging from -1 to 1)
        that you can think of as indicating a "point" off
        of the end of the end effector. The default is [0, 0, -1] which
        causes the end effector to point straight down.
        <p></p>
        J5_direction can alternatively be an array of two angles (in degrees)
        indicating a direction (pitch and yaw). However it cannot be<br/>
        [90, 90], [-90, 90], [90, -90] or [-90, -90]<br/>
        because they represent singularities. If that's the direction you
        want, use an array of 3 numbers.<br/>
        If J5_direction is null, the current direction of the robot (as set by
        the most recent DDE instruction) is used.
        <p></p>
        OR, J5_direction can also be a Coor object or the pose of a
        Coor object (a 2D array). If this is format is given for
        J5_direction, then the config and workspace_pose arguments
        are ignored.
        <p></p>
        <b id="Dexter.move_to.config_doc_id">config</b> Default: <code>Dexter.RIGHT_UP_OUT</code> For most points within the reachability of Dexter, there are multiple
        ways in which Dexter can get there. config helps you specify your preference
        as to <i>how</i> Dexter configures its joints to get to the indicated x, y, z.
        There are 3 independent boolean values to determining this configuration.
        They are: <ul>
            <li><i>base-rotation</i> <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> LEFT</code> means J1, the base joint has a negative value,
                ie it is to the right of facing front. Looking down from the top at Dexter this would
                mean its rotated counter clockwise. The opposite direction is
                <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> RIGHT</code>
                or clockwise.</li>
            <li><i>J3-position</i> Joint 3 can be thought of as Dexter's elbow. The elbow can be either
                <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> UP</code> i.e. away from the table or
                <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> DOWN</code>, closer to the table./li>
            <li><i>J4 Position</i> Joint 4 can be thought of as Dexter's wrist. It can be pointing either
                <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> IN</code>, towards the base, or
                <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> OUT</code>, away from the base.</li>
        </ul>
        Config is most easily specified using one of 26 constants such as:
        <code>Dexter.LEFT_DOWN_IN</code> or <code>Dexter.RIGHT_UP_OUT</code>. You can omit 1 or 2 of these value as in
        <code>Dexter.LEFT_IN</code> or <code>Dexter.OUT</code>. The complete list is:<br/>
    <code>Dexter.LEFT</code> => <samp>[0, null, null]</samp><br/>

    <code>Dexter.IN</code>  => <samp>[null, null, 0]</samp>
    <code>Dexter.OUT</code> => <samp>[null, null, 1]</samp>
        The above list is in the series <b>Robot/robot config</b>.
        Not mentioning a boolean (null) means "don't care", ie let DDE figure it out. Since config limits
        the possible options, some configurations will be impossible with some xyz settings and/or
        J5_direction settings. Impossible settings cause an error.<br/>
        If config is null, then the config set by the previous instruction in DDE
        that set config is used.<br/>

    <b>workspace_pose</b> If not passed in or <code>null</code>, this
    defaults to the containing Job's
    <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('job_param_default_workspace_pose_doc_id', event)">default_workspace_pose</a>
    which itself defaults to <code>Coor.Table</code> .
    Determines the "offset" of the xyz arg.<br/>
    <b>j6_angle</b>  Default: <code>[0]</code> The angle to move Joint 6 to.
    Wrapping it in an array makes the movement relative.
    The default of <code>[0]</code> causes Joint 6 not to move.<br/>
    <b>j7_angle</b>  Default: <code>[0]</code> The angle to move Joint 7 to.
    Wrapping it in an array makes the movement relative.
    The default of <code>[0]</code> causes Joint 7 not to move.
</details> <!--end move_to -->

<details id="Dexter.move_to_relative_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_to_relative</summary>
    This instruction is similar to <code>Dexter.move_to</code> except that the passed in
    xyz array values (in meters) that are ADDED to Dexter's
    existing end effector xyz values, not taken as absolutes. The other arguments to move_to
    are not passed to this function but rather their previously supplied values are used.<br/>
    <i>Parameter</i><br/>
    <b>delta_xyz</b> Default: <code>[0, 0, 0]</code> The other instructions that move Dexter: Dexter.move_all_joints, Dexter.move_home, Dexter.move_to,
     record the position that they've told Dexter to move to. Then Dexter.move_to_relative
     uses that stored position and "increments" it by the supplied delta_xyz.
     Note this "base" is not exactly the position of Dexter, but rather
     the position that its been told to go by previous instructions.
    <b>workspace_pose</b> If not passed in or <code>null</code>, this
    defaults to the containing Job's
    <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('job_param_default_workspace_pose_doc_id', event)">default_workspace_pose</a>
    which itself defaults to <code>Coor.Table</code> .
    Determines the "offset" of the xyz arg.<br/>
    <b>j6_delta_angle</b>  Default: <code>0</code> The relative amount to move Joint 6 to.<br/>
    <b>j7_delta_angle</b>  Default: <code>0</code> The relative amount to move Joint 7 to.
     <p></p>
     <i>Example</i>:
<pre><code>new Job({name: "job_mtr",
         do_list: [Dexter.move_all_joints(Dexter.NEUTRAL_ANGLES),
                   Dexter.move_to_relative([0.005, 0.01, 0])
                   ]})</code></pre>
    Unlike move_to, you cannot wrap x, y. or z in an array as those values
    are already relative.
</details>

<details id="Dexter.move_to_straight_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>move_to_straight</summary>
<code>Dexter.move_to_straight</code> is quite similar to <code>Dexter.move_to</code>.
It takes the same first three arguments as move_to and moves Dexter to
the same spot. The difference is the path that Dexter's end effector takes
to getting to the destination. move_to's path is the path that results
from moving all the joints such that they all start moving at the same
time and stop moving at the same time, but each joint may move at
a different speed than the others. In move_to_straignt,
the path approximates a straight line.
<p></p>
Dexter achieves this by breaking up the distance between the start
and end xyz locations into many short straight-line segments where
the start and end location of each of these segments is on
a straight line between the starting and ending locations.
<p></p>
<i>Parameters passed by keyword:</i><br/>
<b>xyz</b> An array of 3 numbers indicating the x, y, and z location to
           move to. Same as move_to.<br/>
<b>J5_direction</b> The ending direction that LINK5 will be pointing when
    the move is complete. Same as move_to.<br/>
<b>config</b>  Default: <code>Dexter.RIGHT_UP_OUT</code> The configuration of the joints at the end of the move.
    Same as move_to.<br/>
<b>tool_speed</b> The maximum speed that Dexter's end effector will move.
                  Default: 5 millimeters per second. Not in move_to.<br/>
<b>resolution</b> How short to make the straight lines that connect the
starting xyz to the ending xyz. Default: 0.5 millimeters.<br/>
<b>j6_angle</b>  Default <code>[0]</code> The degrees move move Joint 6 to.
If it is wrapped in an array, move relative by that amount.<br/>
<b>j7_angle</b>  Default <code>[0]</code> The degrees move move Joint 7 to.
    If it is wrapped in an array, move relative by that amount.<br/>
<b>single_instruction</b> Default: <code>false</code> False means generate
many instructions within DDE to send to Dexter to cause it to
move in a straight line.
A true value means generate just one make_ins "T" instruction
to send to Dexter. Dexter will then compute the numerous little moves
to get Dexter to move in a straight line.
A make_ins with an oplet of "T" looks like:
<pre><code title="unEVALable">
make_ins("T",
         x, y, z,
         J5_direction[0], J5_direction[1], J5_direction[2],
         config[0], config[1], config[2],
         tool_speed, resolution,
         j6_angle, j7_angle)
         </code></pre>
<p></p>
Example:<br/>
<pre><code> new Job({name: "job_mts",
          do_list: [Dexter.move_to([0, 0.55, 0.075]),
                    Dexter.move_to_straight({xyz: [0, 0.5, 0.075]})]
          })</code></pre>
Moves Dexter's end effector from location: [0, 0.55, 0.075] to
location [0, 0.5, 0.075] in a straight line.

<details id="Dexter.read_file_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>read_file</summary>
    This instruction allows you to transfer the content of a file on Dexter into
    a user_data variable in the enclosing Job.
    <p></p>
    If you are using the simulator, this can move the contents of a file meant to
    simulate a file on Dexter (but is really on
    the computer running DDE) into a user_data variable.
    <br/>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>source</b> A string. Required. The path of a file on Dexter's file system who's
    contents you want to get.<br/>
    If the file does not start with a slash, then, for example,<br/>
    <code>"foo.txt"</code> resolves to:<br/>
    When not simulating: <code>"/srv/samba/share/foo.txt"</code><br/>
    When simulating: <code>"Documents/dde_apps/dexter_file_systems/{robot_name}/foo.txt"</code><br/>
    <b>destination</b> A string. Default: <code>"read_file_content"</code><br/>
     The name of a user data variable on the running
    job that will be written (or over-written) with the contents
    of the file indicated in "source".<br/>
    If the file does not exist, the value of the_job_instance.user_data.{destination}
    will be set to a positive integer error code, usually 1. <br/>
    An error message will be printed in the output pane telling you that the file content
    could not be retrieved, but the Job itself does not error.
    Subsequent instructions can test for the validity of the content with
    <code title="unEVALable">typeof(this.user_data.{destination}) == "string")</code><br/>
    Thus <i>Dexter.read_file</i> can be used to test for the existence of the file,
    not just get its content.
    <p></p>
    <i>Example:</i>
    <pre><code>new Job({name: "job_rfr",
         do_list: [
                   Dexter.read_file("aa.dde", "aa_content"),
                   function(){
                     if(typeof(this.user_data.aa_content) == "string"){
                        out("got the aa content!")
                     }

the instructions created are <code>Dexter.move_to</code> instructions.
<ul><li><b>filepath</b> Default: <code>null</code> A string representing the name of the gcode file under the <b>dde_apps</b> folder
    containing the gcode instructions. The file can be directly under dde_apps or
    nested in subfolders of any depth. Typically the filepath will have an extension of ".gcode"
    but that isn't required by filepath.
    If this defaults to <code>null</code>, only the <i>gcode</i> argument supplies the
    actual gcode to use.
    </li>
    <li><b>gcode</b> Default: <code>""</code> This string is
    prepended to the gcode from the filepath argument. It is intended to
    allow a user to "customize" the gcode in the file with some "header" codes.
    A second use case is if you have a string of gcode but no file,
    you can just let the filepath default to null and only the value of the <i>gcode</i>
    argument will be used.</li>
    <li><b>workspace_pose</b> Default:
         <code>Vector.make_pose([0, 0.5, 0.1], [0, 0, 0], _mm)</code>
        Gcode files indicate line endpoint positions as dimensionless units.
       DDE requires the x,y,z positions passed to the <code>Dexter.move_to</code>
       instructions created by run_gcode to be in meters.
       <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> workspace_pose</code> acts to scale,
       rotate and offset the positions in the gcode.
       <p></p>
       For instance, if the last argument to a call to <code>Vector.make_pos</code>
       is <code>_mm</code>
       as it is in the default for workspace_pose,
       you are declaring that the position numbers in the gcode
       are intended to be in millimeters. The position numbers will be multipled
       by the value of _mm (which is 0.001) before they are passed into
       the generated move_to instructions. Thus a gcode position value of 2
       will be multipled by 0.001 to yield 0.002 and that is the number
       used in the move_to argument, since move_to expects meters.
       Conversely, if you pass in <code>_m</code> (which is 1),
       your gcode position values are expeceted to be in meters.
       <p></p>

    </li>
</ul>
    <i>Examples:</i><br/>
    <pre><code>Dexter.run_gcode({gcode: "G1 X0 Y5 Z8",
                  position_units: _mm})
          </code></pre>
    run_gcode can also take a robot instance as its subject like so:
    <pre><code>Robot.dexter0.run_gcode({gcode: "G1 X0 Y5 Z8",
                  position_units: _mm})
          </code></pre>
    <code>Dexter.run_gcode</code> is similar to <code>Dexter.draw_dxf</code>.
    <code>Dexter.run_gcode</code> only handles G0 and G1 instructions,
    and only their X, Y, and Z arguments.
    It treats G0 and G1 the same.<br/>
    <code>Dexter.run_gcode</code> needs lots of work to handle more gcodes.

<details id="Dexter.sleep_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>sleep</summary>
  Causes Dexter to "go to sleep" for the number of seconds in the one argument.
  When Dexter receives the instruction, it waits for that duration
  before returning control to the DDE job.<br/>
  <i>Example</i>:<code>Dexter.sleep(2)</code><br/>
  Sleeps for 2 seconds.<p></p>
  If you effectively want sleep to occur in DDE for any robot,
  you can use a do_list_item of <code>Dexter.wait_until(2)</code>
  to wait for 2 seconds.

<details id="Dexter.write_file_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>write_file</summary>
    A Dexter instruction that Writes a file on Dexter's file system.
    The file is transmitted through
   DDE's socket interface to the Linux OS runnning on Dexter's processor
   board.<br/>
   <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
    <b>file_name</b> The name of the file to be written on Dexter.
    Example: <code>"/srv/samba/share/AdcCenters.txt"</code> is
    where calibration data is written.<br/>
   <b>content</b> A string. Default: <code>""</code>
    The content to be written. This function automatically escapes
    null, semicolon and percent (the escape character) in a_string
    for transmission.
    <br/>
    <i>Example:</i><br/>
    <code>Dexter.write_file("/srv/samba/share/greeting.txt", "hello world")</code><br/>
    This instruction requires an upgrade to Dexter's software available May, 2018.
    <p></p>

    <code id="Dexter.write_to_robot_doc_id">Dexter.write_to_robot</code> is a similar instruction,
    except that the default folder
    for the <i>file_name</i> is "/srv/samba/share/" and not
    "/srv/samba/share/dde_apps" as it is for <code>Dexter.write_file</code>.
    Also write_to_robot has its content argument 1st, and its file_name argument 2nd.
    <code>Dexter.write_to_robot</code> is maintained for backwards compatibility.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Dexter Modes</summary>
Dexter can be put into one of several <i>modes</i> that governs its behavior.
This is done by putting any one of the following Dexter instructions
into a job. When the instruction is run, Dexter will go into that mode.
<p></p>
Dexter maintains the last mode it was set to even across jobs, across DDE launches,
and across power cycling Dexter.
<p></p>
The default mode is <i>set_keep_position</i>
<p></p>
All of these instructions take an optional Dexter instance argument.
If it is not passed, the instruction will be sent to the Job's robot.
If it is passed, the instruction will be sent to that robot.
    <details id="Dexter.set_follow_me_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>set_follow_me</summary>
        The joints are freed up and the user can drag Dexter's end-effector.
        Dexter's motion instructions (move_to, move_all_joints, etc.) will not work in this mode.
        <p></p>
        <i>Parameters:</i> None<br/>
        <i>Example</i>: (as an instruction in a job's do_list.) <br/>

    <details id="Dexter.set_force_protect_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>set_force_protect</summary>
        Dexter will move to the locations it is told to by instructions.
        But if Dexter is bumped or runs into an object (ie a <i>quick</i> force)
        it will move out of the way.
        However, if a <i>slow</i> force is applied, even if that force is large,
        Dexter will counter that force and attempt to maintain its position.
        <p></p>
        <i>Parameters:</i> None<br/>
        <i>Example</i>: (as an instruction in a job's do_list.) <br/>
        <code>Dexter.set_force_protect()</code>

    <details id="Dexter.set_keep_position_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>set_keep_position</summary>
        Dexter will move to the locations it is told to by instructions.
        Dexter will actively compensate for any applied forces.
        This mode creates the most accurate joint angles and paths.
        This is the default mode.
        <p></p>
        <i>Parameters:</i> None<br/>

<details class="doc_details"  id="RobotStatus_doc_id"><summary>RobotStatus</summary>
    When an instruction is sent to Dexter from DDE, Dexter sends back to DDE
    an array of 60 numbers containing robot status information. The DDE menu
    item <b>Jobs/Show robot status</b> presents this array in a chart labeling
    each number so you can make sense of it.
    <p></p>
    The Robot status array is stored on each Dexter instance under, for example:<br/>
    <code>Dexter.dexter0.robot_status</code><br/>
    You can use constants bound to index
    values to extract particular values like so:
    <code>Dexter.dexter0.robot_status[Dexter.J1_MEASURED_ANGLE]</code><br/>
    See the full list of such constants in the documentation for
    <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Control.grab_robot_status_doc_id')">Control.grab_robot_status</a>
    <p></p>
    <code>RobotStatus</code> is a class whose instances store information about
    a Dexter robot. Each Dexter robot instance has a field named <code title="unEVALable">rs</code>
    i.e. <code>Dexter.dexter0.rs</code>
    whose value is an instance of <code>RobotStatus</code>.
    <p></p>
    The following are instance methods on <code>RobotStatus</code> that make it easy

<details id="Robot.dexter0.prop_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>prop</summary>
<b>prop</b> is a Dexter instance method that takes a string
naming a property and returns it's value.
Most of the values are numbers.<br/>
<i>Example</i>:<br/>
<code>Robot.dexter0.prop("LINK1")</code> => <samp>0.1651</samp><p></p>
<i>Parameters</i>:<br/>
<b>prop</b> A string naming the property who's value will be returned.<br/>
<b>get_from_dexter</b> If <code>true</code>, the value will be retrieved from the
current value of the file //robot.ip_address./share/robot_props.json<br/>
If <code>false</code> (the default):<br/>
If the Dexter instance has the property as an instance property,
its value is returned.<br/>
Else if the property is included in the file
on the dexter robot named //robot.ip_address./share/robot_props.json<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<code>"//192.168.1.142/share/robot_props.json"</code><br/>
then a value specific to the robot is returned.
This is used for link lengths (properties LINK1, LINK2 ... LINK5)
because each Dexter has very slightly different link lengths.
Due to Dexter's precision, we must take these lengths into
account when moving the robot to a location.<br/>
Else if the the property is a class property of Dexter
(used for "typical values" or values appropriate for all Dexters),
then that value is returned.<br/>
Otherwise, <code>undefined</code> is returned.
<p></p>
You may add a property to a dexter instance like so:<br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Robot.dexter0.my_val = 123</code><br/>
and you can access that via <br/>
<code>Robot.dexter0.my_val</code> or <br/>
<code>Robot.dexter0.prop("my_val")</code><br/>
If you want this value to persist accross DDE launches,
just stick<br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Robot.dexter0.my_val = 123</code><br/>
in the file "dde_apps/dde_init.js"

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Dexter Instance Properties</summary>
  Each instance of the Dexter class has quite a few properties.
  Inspect the Dexter instance to see them all.
  This section just documents a few of them.<br/>
  <b>Link Lengths</b> <code>Dexter.dexter0.Link1</code>,
                      <code>Dexter.dexter0.Link2</code>,
                      <code>Dexter.dexter0.Link3</code>,
                      <code>Dexter.dexter0.Link4</code>,
                      <code>Dexter.dexter0.Link5</code>
    contain the length in meters of each link. These are all between
    <code>0.34</code> and <code>0.08</code> for normal Dexters, but vary depending on hte particular Dexter.
    Note that <code>Dexter.LINK1</code> (through 5) are constants for the typical Dexter,
    but Dexter.dexter0.Link1 are likely to be more accurate for the particular Dexter.<br/>
  <b>J1_angle_max</b> thru <b>J5_angle_max</b>
     These properties contain the maximum angle in degrees for a given Joint.
     Values range from 90 to 150 degrees.
     Rarely are these changed, but you <i>can</i> set them using an instruction like:<br/>
     <code>Dexter.set_parameter("J1BoundryHigh", 95)</code><br/>
  <b>J1_angle_min</b> thru <b>J5_angle_min</b>.
    These properties contain the minimum angle in degrees for a given Joint.
    Values range from -150 to -90 degrees.<br/>
    Rarely are these changed, but you <i>can</i> set them using an instruction like:<br/>
    <code>Dexter.set_parameter("J1BoundryLow", -95)</code><br/>
    <i>Example:</i><br/>
    <code>Dexter.dexter0.J2_angle_max</code><br/>
    These parameters are initialized at the start of the first job that uses the given robot.
    If values for a specific robot are not found on the robot,
    values are set from constants such as:<br/>
     <code>Dexter.LINK3</code><br/>
     <code>Dexter.J4_ANGLE_MIN</code><br/>
     <code>Dexter.J5_ANGLE_MAX</code>

<details id="Human_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Human</summary>
<b>Human</b> is a "robot" that is commanded to do things via pop up dialog boxes.
Examples of its instructions are <code>Human.task</code>, and <code>Human.enter_number</code>.
When a human instruction is run, a dialog box is shown and the job waits for a user to
enter some information and click on a button to either cancel the job (and dependent jobs)
or proceed.
<p></p>
Human instructions are a way to encode tasks that Dexter can't do or information
that it can't know. The inclusion of human instructions in DDE permits the design and
running of jobs that need coodination between humans and machines.
<p></p>
Although the "home" of human instructions is in the <i>Human</i> robot, you can use
these instructions in a job with <i>any</i> robot. They do not attempt to
access robot hardware.
<p></p>
<a href="http://hdrobotic.com/webinar#human_instructions" target="_blank">Human Instructions</a>
is a video describing most of the Human instructions.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Human Instructions</summary>

<details id="Human.speak_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>speak</summary>
  Human.speak is an instruction that calls <a href="#" onclick="open_doc(speak_doc_id)">speak</a>.
  It takes all the same arguments except, it does not take a "callback" arg, and
  it takes one extra arg:<br/>
  <i>Parameter:</i><br/>
  <b>wait</b> Boolean, default: <code>true</code>. When true
  the job pauses while the speaking is occuring, then performs the
  next instruction when the speaking is done.
  <i>Example:</i>
  <pre><code>new Job({name: "j1",
         do_list: [
           Human.speak({speak_data: "hi there folks",
                        rate: 0.25,
                        wait: true}),
           IO.out("done")
         ]})</code></pre>
   This job doesn't print "done" until after "hi there folks" has been spoken.
</details>

<details id="Human.task_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>task</summary>
  When run, all human instructions present a dialog box on the screen and waits until the
  user clicks the <button>Done</button> button before allowing the job to proceed to the
  next instruction in its do_list. A <button>Stop Job</button> button is
  also presented. If clicked, this job and its dependent jobs are stopped.<p></p>
  <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
  <b>task</b> Default: "". A string that will appear in the body of the dialog box. It is intended
     as an English instruction to the human reading it. When the human has completed
     the instruction, they should press <button>Done</button>.
     If the human is unable to complete the task, they should press
     <button>Stop Job</button><p></p>
  <b>add_stop_button</b> Default: <code>true</code> Adds a button that, when clicked,
     will stop this job and the give dependent jobs without executing additional instructions.<br/>
  <b>dependent_job_names</b> Default: <code>[]</code>. The names of the jobs that will be stopped if the
       user presses <button>Stop Job</button><br/>
   <b>title</b> Default: the job name and "Human Task". A string shown in the title bar of the dialog.
          To have no title, pass in <code>""</code> .<br/>
   <b>x</b> Default: 200. The number of pixels between the left edge of the dialog and the left edge of the DDE window.<br/>
   <b>y</b> Default: 200. The number of pixels between the top edge of the dialog and the top edge of the DDE window.<br/> 
   <b>width</b> Default: 400. The width of the dialog box in pixels.<br/>
   <b>height</b> Default: 400. The height of the dialog box in pixels.<br/>
   <b>background_color</b> Default: "rgb(238, 238, 238)" i.e. light gray. The background color of the dialog box.
    Each of the numbers for red, green, and blue can be between 0 and 255 inclusive. 0,0,0 is black.<br/>
    <i style="color:rgb(200,0,200);">All of these parameters are common to <b>all</b> human instructions. 
      All are optional. They affect the appearance of the dialog box, except for</i>
      <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> dependent_job_names</code>.
    <p></p>
    <i>Examples:</i>
    <pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite"> new Job({name: "my_job",

<details id="Human.enter_choice_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>enter_choice</summary>
  <code>Human.enter_choice</code> presents a dialog
  allowing the user to choose one of several supplied options.
  It is the most flexible of the single-value entry Human instructions.
  See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Human.task_doc_id', event)">Human.task</a>
  for behavior common to all Human instructions.<p></p>
  <i>Uncommon Parameters:</i><br/>
  <b>choices</b> Default: <code>[["Yes", true], ["No", false]]</code>. An array of choices.
      The user is allowed to select one of the given choices.<br/>
      Their are several different formats for a choice.
      <ul><li>A string. The string is displayed as the choice, and used as the value
              for the user_data_variable.</li>
          <li>An array of one string. Same as using just a string.</li>
          <li>An array of a string and a value.
              The first element of the array (must be a string) is displayed.
              If the value is a string, it is considered to be JS source code and
              is evaluated when the user clicks the button. The resultant value
              becomes the value of the user_data_variable.
              You may have the variable <code>this</code> in the string.
              It will have the value of the Job that this instruction is in.
              Note that you <i>might</i> not care about the value created but
              are just doing the evaluation for its side effects. This is as designed.
              You can eval any JS here for maximum flexibility.
              <p></p>
              If the value is not a string, it will be used directly as the
              value of the user_data_variable. The evaluation of this item
              happens at Job definition time.
              <p></p>
              Note that if you want the user data variable to have the value
              as a string, you must use a format like <code>'"foo"'</code>. At Job definition
              time this becomes a string of 5 chars, <code>"foo"</code>.
              Then at button-click time, that is evaled and produces a string
              of 3 chars, <code title="unEVALable">foo</code> which is stored
              in the user_data_variable.
              </li>
          <li>An array of a string, a value and a boolean.
              Same as above but if the boolean is <code>true</code>,
              then the value produced by the array's 2nd element is
              considered to be an instruction and is inserted into
              the Job's do_list right after this Human.enter_choice instruction.</li>
      </ul>

  <b>show_choices_as_buttons</b> true or false, default: false. When false, the choices are 
    shown in a menu with the first choice selected.
    When true, each choice has a button and there is no <button>Done</button> button.
  <b>one_button_per_line</b> true or false, default: false. If true, each button
   appears on its own line in a vertical stack. If true, the buttons are positioned
   left to right, taking up more than 1 line only when necessary to display the extra buttons.<br/>
  <b>user_data_variable_name</b> Default: "choice". When the user clicks <button>Done</button>, 
  the selected choice will be made the value of the variable named in this parameter.
  That variable will be in the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> user_data</code> of the current job.
  Within another instruction in the same job, the selected choice will be accessible using
  JavaScript. If the user_data_variable_name is 'my_color' and the choice is 'blue'.
  then <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this.users_data.my_color</code> will return <code>'blue'</code>.
  You can access this value from <i>another</i> job via:<br/>
  <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> job.some-job-name.user_data.my_color</code>.
  Note that JavaScript from any job can also reset this value. For example:<br/>
  <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> job.some-job-name.user_data.my_color = 'green'</code>.
  <p></p>
  <i>Examples:</i>
  <pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite"> new Job({name: "my_job",
          do_list: [Human.enter_choice({task: "Please pick one.",
                                         choices: ["aa", "bb", "cc"]}),
                    function(){out("You chose: " + this.user_data.choice)}
  ]})     </code></pre>
  Above we define 3 choices and display them in the default select menu.
  The default user_data_variable_name is <code>"choice"</code>, which
  can be read by any subsequent instruction. Using the default is a bit dangerous
  because it will be overwritten by a subsquent Human.enter_choice instruction
  (though that <i>might</i> be what you want).

  <pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite"> new Job({name: "my_job",
          do_list: [Human.enter_choice({task: "Ready?",
                                        choices: [["Yes", true], ["No", false]],
                                        show_choices_as_buttons: true}),
                    function(){out("You chose: " + this.user_data.choice)}
  ]})     </code></pre>
  Above, When the user clicks on "Yes" or "No",
  user_data.choice will be bound to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.

  <pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite">
  function myfn() {out("The job name is: " + this.name)}
  new Job({name: "my_job",
           show_instructions: Job.prototype.show_progress_and_user_data,
           do_list:
  [Human.enter_choice({
        choices: ["aa",
                  ["bb"],
                  ["cc", true],
                  ["dd", '"joe"'],
                  ["ee", 'this.name + " is cool"'],
                  ["ff", 'myfn.call(this)'],
                  ["gg", 'IO.out("hey")', true]
                 ],
           show_choices_as_buttons: true,
           add_stop_button: false,
           user_data_variable_name: "mychoice",
           height: 150
      })]})  </code></pre>
    Above we use <code title="unEVALable">show_instructions: Job.prototype.show_progress_and_user_data</code>
    so that our Job's user_data will be printed out in the progress bar, updated after
    each instruction is executed. This makes it easy to see our user-data as it is set.
    <p></p>
    We've used all the different kinds of choices described above. <br/>
    <b>"bb"</b> behaves the same as "aa"<br/>
    <b>"cc"</b> sets our user_data_variable to <code>true</code><br/>
    <b>"dd"</b> set our user_data_varabie to a string of 3 chars, joe.<br/>
    <b>"ee"</b> has the given source code evaled with <code>this</code> bound to
                the Job instance.<br/>
    <b>"ff"</b> calls <code title="unEVALable">myfn</code>. If you have
                something other than a very simple snippet, we recommend
                putting it in a function and calling it. That makes it
                easier to test and is overal more reliable.
                By using <code title="unEVALable">call</code> with a first arg,
                the value of <code>this</code> inside the function body will be
                that first arg's value.<br/>
    <b>"gg"</b> creates a new instruction and inserts it in the Job's do_list
                right below this Human.enter_choice instruction.
</details>

<details id="Human.enter_filepath_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>enter_filepath</summary>
When run, this instruction pops up a window containing the HTML input file
element. The user clicks a button to select a file.
When the user clicks on the submit button,
the chosen file is set to the Job's user_data variable
passed in. This instruction has the usual options for Human.enter
instructions.
<i>Parameter:</i>
<b>user_data_variable_name</b> Default: <code>"a_filepath"</code>
A string of the name of the user_data variable in the job
to set to the chosen file.
If no file is chosen, the variable is bound to <code>null</code>

    <code>Human.enter_number</code> presents a dialog allowing the user to enter a number via typing or clicking.

  <p></p>
  <i>Uncommon Paramaters:</i><br/>
  <b>initial_value</b> Default: <code>0</code>.</br/>
  <b>min</b> Default: <code>0</code>. The minimun acceptable value.<br/>
  <b>max</b> Default: <code>100</code>. The maximum acceptable value.<br/>
  <b>step</b> Default: <code>1</code>. The step size that clicking on the
            increment and decriment arrows will add or subtract
             to the current value.<br/>
  <b>user_data_variable_name</b> Default: <code>"a_number"</code>.
       Where the chosen number is stored.
  <p></p>
  <i>Examples:</i>
  <pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite"> new Job({name: "my_job",
  do_list: [Human.enter_number({task: "How much?"}),
            function(){ out("Amount: " +
                        this.user_data.a_number)}]})
            </code></pre>
    In the above example, the 2nd instruction couldn't be simply
    <code title="unEVALable">IO.out("Amount: " this.user_data.a_number)</code><br/>
    nor even:<br/>
    <code title="unEVALable">IO.out("Amount: " Job.my_job.user_data.a_number)</code><br/>
    because each of those would be evaluated during the call to<br/>
    <code title="unEVALable">new Job(...)</code> and thus
    the new job would not yet be defined, much less have the
    first instruction run.
    By wrapping this in a function, we get the critical code
    evaled at the time the 2nd instruction is called,
    AND we have <code title="unEVALable">this</code> bound to the
    job instance so we don't have to mention the Job's name inside
    the code. This is important because you might want to change its name and
    don't want the code to break if you do.

    <pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite"> new Job({name: "my_job",

</details>
<details id="Human.show_window_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>show_window</summary>
<i>show_window</i> comes in two flavors. The first is as a function that can
be called from any JS code.
It is documented under<br/><a href="#" onclick="open_doc(show_window_doc_id, event)">
Ref Man/Window System/show_window</a>
<p></p>
The second is as a Human robot instruction. It is documented here but
you will need the function-equivalent documentation to understand the show_window instruction.
<code>Human.show_window</code> is very similar to  <code>show_window</code>,
but intended to be an instruction in a job. When the show_window instruction
is run, a dialog box pops up containing its content, just like the function,
except that it pauses the job that it is in.
Clicking on buttons, etc, calls the callback function, just like the function.
But when a "submit" button is clicked or something else in the
callback function that also closes the window, such as a call to
<code title="unEVALable code fragment.">close_window(vals.window_index)</code>,
here's what happens:
<ol><li>The dialog box is closed.</li>
    <li>The argument to the callback function that contains all the values
        of all the input widgets is bound to the Job's <samp>user_data</samp> variable
        named in user_data_variable_name argument to the instruction.
        These values can be used by subsequent instructions.</li>
    <li>The instruction is finished, and the next instruction in the Job's
        do-list (if any) is run.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
If you just want to get one value at a time from a user, its easier to
use the other Human instructions for number, text, etc. But
if you want to get multiple values in one dialog, using this
instruction is the way to go.
<p></p>
<i>Parameters:</i><br/>
The vast majority of the parameters to the show_window instruction are the same
as to the show_window function. Here we only document differences.<br/>
<b>callback</b> Very similar to the function-equivalent except that
when it is called, <code title="unEVALable JS fragment">this</code> is bound
to the job that the instruction is in. You can use <code>this</code> to, for instance, stop the job,
by calling (within the callback)
<code title="unEVALable JS fragment">this.stop_for_reason("interrupted", "your explanation.")</code>
<br/>It is common in using this instruction to not have a callback function, since the
real action(s) taken due to the values that the user has input occurs by subsequent
instructions in the job that read those values from the Job's user_data.<br/>
<b>user_data_variable_name</b> Default: <code>"show_window_vals"</code>.
Similar to other Human instructions, this is the place that values from
input elements are stored when the dialog is closed.
<p></p>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<pre><code title="unstartable in TestSuite">new Job({name: "my_job",
         do_list:
           [Human.show_window({content:
`First name: &lt;input type="text" name="first_name"/>&lt;br/>
 Last name:  &lt;input type="text" name="last_name"/>&lt;br/>
 &lt;input type="submit" value="Done"/>`,
                          user_data_variable_name: "my_name"}),
            function(){ out("Hello, " +
                            this.user_data.my_name.first_name + " " +
                            this.user_data.my_name.last_name)}]})
                         </code></pre>
    In this example, we don't care about the callback function.
    The values of the first and last name that the user entered are
    stored in<br/>
    <code title="unEvalable JS fragment">Job.my_job.user_data.my_name.first_name</code> (and last_name)<br/>
    then used by the 2nd instruction to print them out.
    <p></p>
    An easy debugging trick, is that you can EVAL the call to <code>show_window</code>
    and see the dialog that will be presented, by running the instruction WITHOUT
    actually running the job. To do this for the above example, select the
    text starting with <code>show_window</code> and continuing only through
    its close paren, excluding the following comma separating it from the
    next instruction. Then click the <button>Eval</button> button.
    <p></p>
    Note that when you click on buttons in the resulting dialog,
    <code title="unEVALable JS fragment">this</code> will not be bound to
    the surrounding job, but otherwise the callback should behave the same
    as it does when running the whole job.

<details id="Serial_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Serial</summary>
<i>Serial</i> is not a specific robot per se, its a connection to another computer via its serial port.
This connection is very general. It knows nothing about the actual capabilities of what its
connected to, only that it can send and receive strings on its serial port.
<p></p>
DDE's Serial robot is quite similar to Dexter from DDE's perspective. It
can be sent instructions from a Job's do_list and its output is interpreted as
a "robot_status" similarly to Dexter's robot_status. The Serial robot has been
used to connect to Arduino boards via its USB connector, and should work with Raspberry Pi and other
similar devices.

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Arduino</summary>
In order for the serial port connection to work with Arduino, you need to have
the Arduino IDE installed. Its a free and easy download from 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc">https://www.arduino.cc</a>
<p></p>If you don't get a connection, sometimes unplugging and replugging the 
USB cable will help. You can also try relaunching DDE.
Another debugging techinque is using the Arduino IDE's menubar/Tools/Serial Monitor.
The upper type in area is for a string that you want to send to the board.
The lower area displays strings coming back from the board.
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Arduino and Mac</summary>
Beware: It appears that Arduino plays poorly with Macintosh computers.
We've been unsuccessful at connecting a Sparkfun RedBoard with Mac and
have heard of other problems between Arduino's Uno R3 boards. We've had success
with Arduino Leonardo and believe Arduino Micro will also work due to its
similar communication architecture. (Feb 2017) The Arduino Micro cannot
accomodate standard Arduino add-on (shield) boards but the Leonardo can.
</details> <!-- end Arduino and Mac-->

Create an instance of Serial similar to the other robots. Example: <br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> new Serial({name: "S1", ...})</code><p></p>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Parameters to new Serial</summary>
<b>name</b> A string. Makes this instance of a Serial Robot accessible from Robot.the_name<br/>

<b>simulate</b> <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> or <code>null</code>. Default <code>null</code>.
If <code>true</code>, no data is sent or recieved over the actual serial port.<br/>
If <code>null</code>, the actual value for simulate comes from the Misc pane header simulate radio buttons,
just like for Dexter robots.<br/>

<b>sim_fun</b> A function. Default <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> return_first_arg</code>.
Used only when <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> simulate: true</code><br/>
When a Serial.string.instruction is simulated, its argument,
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> instruction_string</code> is
passed to the sim_fun. The value returned from calling sim_fun is the simulated return value (a string)
from the serial port for this instruction. The function can use any JavaScript to compute
the returned string. <p></p>
Consider the item_delimiter when making up this returned string. Often
the string should end in the item_delimiter, but it doesn't have to. <p></p>
We're not expecting
the sim_fun to do exactly what the Serial hardware would do. In fact if it could,
there would be no need for the hardware! Rather sim_fun should perform as a diagnostic
for at least one case or perhaps a few cases of instruction strings.
The default value of <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> return_first_arg</code> just returns its input to help you verify that
the basic communication path is working.<br/>

<b>path</b> A string. Required. The label for the device connected to a serial port on the computer running DDE 
that you want this software robot to connect to.
Valid paths can be seen by calling<br/>
<code>serial_devices()</code><br/>
On Windows, they look something like
 <code>"COM3"</code>.
On Mac, they look something like <code>"/dev/tty.usbmodem1411"</code>. 
 In addition to the tty path, Mac's also have a "cu" path such as: <code>"/dev/cu.usbmodem1411"</code>.
 We've found both <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> tty</code> and
 <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> cu</code> paths to work with DDE.<br/>

<b>connect_options</b> A literal object. Default <code>{}</code>. <br/>
Example: <code>{baudRate: 9600}</code> <br/>
9600 is the default baudRate (which is the same as bitrate, i.e. bits per second). All options documented at
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport#serialport-path-options-opencallback">https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport#serialport-path-options-opencallback</a><br/>

<b>capture_n_items</b> A non-negative integer. Default <code>1</code>.<br/>
DDE waits until it has recieved capture_n_items from the device before calling the next instruction on
the job's do_list. The string returned by the serial device is cut up by
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> item_delimiter</code>,
to determine the number of items returned by the serial device.
<br/>

<b>item_delimiter</b> A string. Default <code>"\\n"</code>. Note that Arduino's 
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Serial.println("foo")</code> will send out a 5 character string of <code>"foo\\r\\n"</code><br/>

<b>trim_whitespace</b> A boolean. Default <code>true</code>.
If this is true, then an "item" (string) returned by the serial port, will have the
whitespace at its beginning and end removed. Note that with the defaults in place
of an item_delimiter of <code>"\\n"</code>, and trim_whitespace of <code>true</code>,
then when Arduino executes: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Serial.println("hi")</code> the actual 4 characters
transmitted to DDE are: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> vhi\\r\\n</code>. It is recognized as one item because
it ends in the delimiter, giving us a 3 character item, except that the
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> vtrim_whitespace</code>
takes off that final <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> v\\r</code> and we're left with
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> hi</code>, usually what you want.
<p></p>
This arrangement gets around our society's failure to set one standard for the most important formatting
operation, breaking up of lines, with <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> \\n</code> being used by Unix and Mac, and
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> \\r\\n</code> being used by Windows and Arduino. DDE tries to use the more
sensible <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> \\n</code> where possible. Thus <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> \\n</code> can be our
default item_delimiter and we still win calling Arduino's
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Serial.println</code>.
<br/>

<b>parse_items</b> true or false. Default true. If true, the returned items will be converted from strings to
primitive JS data types: booleans, numbers, arrays, literal objects, strings, and aggrigates of such.
Example: In Arduino C, you could have a program that executes: 
<br/><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Serial.println("[1, 20, 300]");</code><br/>
With <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> parse_items: true</code> that would result in DDE's robot_status array as an element of
an array of three integers.

<b>capture_extras</b> One of "error", "ignore" or "capture". Default "error". 
<ul><li><code>"error"</code> means that any extra data output by the board will cause an error, halting the current job.</li>
    <li><code>"capture"</code> means that extra output will be appended onto the end of the robot_status associated
        with the last instruction sent. Beware that such data won't be available as soon as the expected
        data of capture_n_items has been received.</li> 
     <li><code>"ignore"</code> means that any items after capture_n_items and before the next instruction sent will
        be thrown away, but will not cause an error.</li>
</ul>
<b>instruction_callback</b> A function that is called when a valid return value is received
to control what a job should do next. The default causes the next instruction in the Job's
do_list to be executed. Usually you won't want to change this.<br/>
</details> <!-- End Serial parameters to new -->

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Serial Instructions</summary>
<details id="Serial.string_instruction_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>string_instruction</summary>
takes one argument, a string, which is sent to the Serial robot.
If the argument is <i>not</i> a string, it is converted to one using <code>JSON.stringify</code> .
The functionality of that string is entirely dependent on how the device
you are sending it to, interprets it.<br/>
Example: <code>Serial.string_instruction(4.5)</code><br/>
sends the 3 character string: <code>"4.5"</code>  to the serial robot.
<p></p>
This instruction causes the Job its in to pause until the instruction
completes.
<p></p>
If you'd like to send string instructions to more than one serial port,
you can use an instance of a serial port as the subject of a string_instruction.<br/>
Example:
<pre><code title="not in TestSuite">
new Serial({name: "S2",
            path: "/dev/tty.usbmodem2822"
           })
new Job({name: "j1",
         robot: new Serial({name: "S1",
                            path: "/dev/tty.usbmodem1411"}),
         do_list: [Serial.string_instruction("hi"),
                   Serial.S2.string_instruction("hey")]})
    </code></pre>
The first instruction goes to Serial robot "S1".
The second goes to Serial robot "S2".<br/>
See Jobs menu/Insert Example/Serial Port for an extended example.
</details>

<details  class="doc_details"><summary>Control.grab_robot_status</summary>
This is not a <i>Serial</i> instruction, but one that can be used
with any robot. It captures the robot_status, or some portion of it,
and saves it away in a user_data variable on the Job instance for
use by subsequent instructions.
<p></p>
When a Serial.string_instruction is run and the device retruns a value,
that string is placed in the robot_status. You can then use
Control.grab_robot_status to extract it from the robot status
and stick it in a user_data variable.
See <a href="#" onclick="open_doc('Control.grab_robot_status_doc_id')">
        Control.grab_robot_status</a>
</details>


</details> <!-- end of Serial Instructions -->
<details class="doc_details"><summary>Multiple Serial Ports</summary>
Normally, each Job has a robot. If you must connect to multiple
serial ports, you can set up a Job for each one and give
its robot one of the serial ports you need to connect to.
<p></p>
However, you can also use the serial port robot as a <i>subject</i> to
the call to a string_instruction. Thus you can call multiple serial
ports in one job. The job will pause until each completes.
In other words, the serial string_instructions run <i>in serial</i>,
not parallel.
<p></p>
You can also call <code>Control.grab_robot_status</code> with a subject of
a robot instance (instead of <code>Robot</code>) so that
you can be sure to get the correct return value from
a given string_instruction instruction.<br/>
<i>Example:</i>
<pre><code title="not in testsuite because works on Mac but not on windows due to the 'comName' reference.">
new Serial({name: "S1", simulate: null,
			sim_fun: function(input){
                        return "got: " + input + "\n"
                     },
            path: last(serial_devices()).comName,
            connect_options: {baudRate: 300},
            capture_n_items: 1,
            parse_items: true}
)
new Job({name: "j10b",
         robot: new Brain(), //not used, but prevents the default Robot.dexter0 from being used
         do_list: [Robot.S1.string_instruction("y"),
                   Robot.S1.grab_robot_status("yes_result"),
                   Control.wait_until(2),
                   Robot.S1.string_instruction("n"),
                   Robot.S1.grab_robot_status("no_result", Serial.DATA0)
                   ]}
)

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Debugging Serial</summary>
Due to the interplay between two different computers (the one running DDE and the Serial device)
and their entirely different software protocols, debugging Serial robot interfaces is challenging.
DDE provides a number of low level functions that can be invoked without interacting with a job
to help you verify connectivity.<p></p>

<b id="serial_devices_doc_id"><code>serial_devices()</code></b> Returns an array of objects representing
the available devices on serial ports. the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> comName</code> field holds the path to the serial
port that you can use to connect to that device. 
<p></p>

<b id="serial_path_to_info_map_doc_id"><code>serial_path_to_info_map</code></b> Holds the mapping between the
path of a serial device and lots of properties about it, most of which come from defining
the associated Serial robot. The value of this global variable is a JS literal object with
keys of each path to which there is a serial connection, and values of
another JS literal object holding useful properties of that connection, i.e. its "info".<p></p>
You can get the info for a path via <br/>
<code title="unEVALable code fragment"> serial_path_to_info_map[path]</code>
<p></p>

<b id="serial_connect_low_level_doc_id"><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> serial_connect_low_level("/dev/tty.some_device")</code></b>
Allows you to create a software connection between a serial device and DDE software NOT in a job.
<p></p>

<b id="serial_send_low_level_doc_id"><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> serial_send_low_level( "some_path", "some_string")</code></b>
Allows you to send a string to a serial device from DDE but NOT in a job.
<p></p>

<b id="serial_disconnect_doc_id"><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> serial_disconnect("some_path")</code></b> Disconnects an existing connection.
<p></p>

<b id="serial_flush_doc_id"><code title="unEVALable code fragment"> serial_flush("some_path")</code></b> Removes all bytes in the given path's input and output buffers.
<p></p>
Though strictly unnecessary, we recommend:
<ol>
    <li>supplying a <i>sim_fun</i> to your Serial robot definition</li>
    <li>setting its <i>simulate</i> arg to null</li>
    <li>using the Misc pane header simulate radio buttons to toggle between

<details id="units_system_help_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Units System</summary>
    Throughout DDE, the primary functions and instructions assume SI units for their
    numerical values. Example: length is in meters.
    There are a few exceptions to this rule, but we stick to it for the major functionality.
    Internally, Dexter uses microns for length and arcseconds for degrees,
    but programmers rarely see such numbers.

    However, we recognize that for various reasons, you might want to record numbers
    in some other units. To facilitate that, we provide an easy way to convert
    from other common units into DDE standard units.
    On the DDE menubar/Series/DDE/Units/ you can see the various series for the
    dimensions DDE supports. Pick one to insert it (such as "length" to insert "_km".)
    <code>_km</code> is a global variable bound to a constant number, in this case, 1000.
    To convert a number "my_length" from kilometers to the DDE standard, meters, use
    <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> my_length*_km</code> and that will eval to: my_length * 1000
    which represents my_length in meters instead of kilometers.
    If my_length is 2, and it is meant to refer to 2 kilometers, then
    my_length*_km evals to 2000 and is meant to be in meters.
    You can think of "*_km" as declaring the units that my_length is in.
    <h4>More Examples</h4>
    _unitname is the conversion factor to go from that unitname into the Base Unit for that series.
    For example 1*_rev specifies 1 revolution and because the Base Unit for angles is degrees,
    1*_rev will become 360 and 0.5*_rev will become 180 and so on.
    There is nothing fancy going on behind the scenes, _rev is just a number,
    in this case 360. To go backwards from a base unit to a desired unit simply divide.
    If you were wondering how many revolutions 1 million degrees is eval what's in white below:
    1000000 / _rev
    It works for combination of unit too. For example the Base Unit for speed is meter / second.
    If you are not familiar with how much a m/s is you specify your speed,
     then multiply by _mile / _hour for MPH or _in / _s inches per second.
     These can help with complicated conversions for example:
    <p></p>
    I've run a mile in 4:24 what is that in MPH?
    var meter_per_sec = _mile / (4*_min+24*_s)
    var MPH = meter_per_sec / (_mile/_hour)
    <p></p>
    Mathematically, the notation _unit is shorthand for base_unit / _unit.
    For example the value of _rev is 360 as in there are 360 degrees per 1 revolution.
    This system only works when the Base Unit is assumed.
    DDE "assumes" the Base Units by have every constant in those units and having every
    function only work with the Base Units.
    The majority of Base Units are SI units with a few exceptions:<br/>
    For angles: DDE uses degree instead of radian.<br/>
    For temperature DDE uses -Celsius instead of Kelvin.
    <p></p>
    <h4>Base Units</h4>
    These are the units that DDE uses in its constants and functions.
    These are also the units that the Units System converts to.
    <ul><li>For length: meters</li>
        <li>For angles: degree</li>
        <li>For duration: second</li>
        <li>For weight: kilogram</li>
        <li>For mass: Newton</li>
        <li>For frequency: hertz</li>
        <li>For Pascal</li>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Object System</summary>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>Overview</summary>
An object system helps you organize data that can inherit from
other objects or classes. Most programming languages have a 
class-instance based object system. JavaScript's new class-based
object system is a mediocre class-instance object system.
But the original JavaScript object system is supposed to
be a "prototype" object system. Good prototype object systems
are simpler, more flexible and easier to learn than
class-instance object systems. However, JS's original object
system isn't a good prototype object system as demonstrated by
the numerous object system varients added on to JS, including
JS 6's class object system. 
<p></p>
One of the problems with class-instance object systems is that
they force you to decide whether an object should be a class
or an instance. But sometimes you want to use a particular object
as both a class (to inherit from) and an instance (that
you can set instance variables in). You may also want to
"inhert" from an "instance". One of the most powerful
descriptive mechanisms in natural language is to say
something like "The chair I want is just like this one
except its blue." This is using an instance of a chair
to describe another instance of chair that inherits 
from the first instance. Class-instance object systems
don't allow you to do this, but good prototype object systems
and DDE's object system do.
<p></p>
We've coerced JS's prototype object system into
a more useful one by adding some methods to JavaScript.
These new methods, in conjunction with existing JS functions,
give you a pretty good prototype object system.
<p></p>
</details> <!-- overview -->

<details class="doc_details"><summary>Calling Methods</summary>
Method calls look very similar to Javscript method calls.
Within the body of a method, you can use <code>this</code> to refer
to the object instance that the method was called with, just like JS.
</details>

<details class="doc_details"><summary>New Object System Methods</summary>
DDE augments JS with some new variables, functions and methods to
help you get the most value out of a prototype object system.

<details id="rootObject_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>Root</summary>
<code>Root</code> is a global constant that contains the root object of DDE's object system.
</details>

<details id="newObject_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>newObject</summary>
<code>newObject</code> let's you create a new object. It takes
literal objects as arguments, usually just one.
The properties of the arguments become the properties
of the new object. If two of the input objects have a same named property,
the property in the resulting object will have the value of the <i>last</i> argument.
There are three properties that behave 
specially.
<p></p>
<b><i>prototype</i></b> This property sets the "parent" object
of the new object. <i>prototype</i> defaults to <code>Root</code>.
Once you have the new object, <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> new_obj.prototype</code> gives you
back that prototype. Unlike most other properties, you cannot set this property and win.
Class-instance object systems don't allow you to change the class of an object.
In practice, this usually isn't needed.
<p></p>
<b><i>name</i></b> This optional property gives the new object a "name"
property (as is normal), but it also creates a field in the prototype
object with the new name and a value of the new object. By doing this,
you have a path from the <code>Root</code> to this new object using the
object names from the top on down separated by dot.
The names immediately under the root object are global so
you can omit <code>Root</code> from such paths.
<p></p>
If you want an object to have a name,
supply it when calling newObject. Don't set it afterwards.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<pre><code>newObject({
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: "vehicle",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: "white",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weight: 3000})</code></pre>
    <code>Root.vehicle</code> => the new object<br/>
    <code>Root.vehicle.name</code> => <samp>"vehicle"</samp><br/>
    <code>Root.vehicle.color</code> => <samp>"white"</samp><br/>
<pre><code>newObject({
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prototype: Root.vehicle,
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: "boat",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: "blue"})</code></pre>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat</code> => the new object<br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat.name</code> => <samp>"boat"</samp><br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat.color</code> => <samp>"blue"</samp><br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat.weight</code> => <samp>3000</samp> //inheited from vehicle<br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.color</code> => <samp>"white"</samp> // hasn't changed.<br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.weight = 2000</code><br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat.weight</code> => <samp>2000</samp> //inherits the new value from vehicle<br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.launch = function(){return "set sail"}</code><br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.launch()</code> => <samp>"set sail"</samp><br/>
<code>Root.vehicle.boat.launch()</code> => <samp>"set sail"</samp>
<p></p>
<b><i>constructor</i></b>
When creating an object, (or afterwards) you can set a property named 
<code>constructor</code> in the new object to a method. This method is called
whenever a new object is created with <code>newObject</code>.
Unlike its counterpart in JS6 classes, <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> constructor</code>
is called with no arguments. However, <code>this</code>
is our new object with all the fields populated from the properties
passed in the call to <code>newObject</code>, saving a ton of boiler plate code.
In the body of <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> constructor</code>, you can call any code you like,
including code that modifies the property values, of code title="unEVALable code fragment">this</code>,
create
entirely new properties or remove ones from <code>this</code>.
<p></p>
Example: <pre><code>newObject({name: "animal",
 constructor: function(){ this.fur = "no"}})
 newObject({prototype: Root.animal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name: "fido"})</code></pre>
<p></p>
Above, during the first call to newObject, <code>this</code> is bound
to the <i>animal</i> object. But when the 2nd call to newObect is
made, the <code>this</code> in animal.constructor is bound to
the object in Root.animal.fido.<br/>
Here's the state of the relevant properties:<br/>

<code>Root.animal.fur</code> => <samp>"no"</samp><br/>
<code>Root.animal.fido.fur</code> => <samp>"no"</samp> <br/>

Each object has its own copy of the "fur" property.
Setting one will not set the other.
<p></p>
JS6 class constructor methods can have a call to <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> super</code>.
It's counterpart in DDE is a method whose name makes sense:
<code>callPrototypeConstructor</code>, documented below.
</details>

<details id="callPrototypeConstructor_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>callPrototypeConstructor</summary>
When you have a hierarchy of objects, often you want an object low in the
hierarchy to be initialized similarly to ones higher up, but with
some modifications. Thus you'd have constructor on a "vehicle" object,
then another one on a sub-object, "boat". The boat object should
probably call the constructor for the vehicle object at the top
of the boat constructor, and then make additional modifications to
"this" in the bottom part of the boat constructor method.
<p></p>
Example: <br/>
<pre><code>newObject({name: "animal",
           constructor: function(){ this.fur = "no"}})
newObject({prototype: Root.animal, name: "mammal",
  constructor: function(){<br/>
     this.callPrototypeConstructor()<br/>
     this.fur = "usually"<br/>
     this.hair = "sometimes"<br/>
  	 out("in mammal constructor")}})</code></pre><br/>
After running the above code,<br/>

<code>Root.animal.fur</code> => <samp>"no"</samp>.<br/>
<code>Root.animal.mammal.fur</code> => <samp>"usually"</samp><br/>
<code>Root.animal.mammal.hair</code> => <samp>"sometimes"</samp><br/>

You don't <i>have to</i> call callPrototypeConstructor,
and even if you do, it doesn't have to be before
the lower level constructor function modifies <code>this</code>
though <i>usually</i> these are good practices.
</details>

<details id="Object.isNewObject_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>isNewObject</summary>
Returns true if the argument was created with newObject.
Examples:<br/>
<code>Object.isNewObject({a:11})</code> => <samp>false</samp><br/>
<code>Object.isNewObject(newObject({name: "trash"}))</code> => <samp>true</samp><br/>
</details>
<details class="doc_details"><summary>subObjects</summary>
Returns an array of the named subobjects of <code>this</code><br/>
Example:<br/>
<code>Root.subObjects()</code> => array of the top level named new objects.
</details>

<details id="isLeafObject_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>isLeafObject</summary>
Returns true if the subject has no named subobjects.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<code>Root.isLeafObject()</code> <samp>false</samp>
</details>

<details id="leafObjectNamed_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>leafObjectNamed</summary>
Returns a leaf object below <code>this</code> named by the argument,
or returns null.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
<code>Root.leafObjectNamed("junk747")</code> <samp>null</samp>
</details>

<details id="isSubObject_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>isSubObject</summary>
The primary relationship between objects in DDE's object system
is the prototype relationship. An object inherits properties from
its prototype. If you want an object to have  a different value
for a particular property than its prototype object does,
just create a property in the object, and that will effectiely
"shadow" the prototype value and use the "local" value in the object
for that property. 
<p></p>
An object always knows which object is its prototype. (All objects
have a prototype except Root.) But prototypes only know
what objects have them as their prototype if those other objects
are named, which is optional. 
By giving an object a name, you automatically install a property
in its prototype with a key of that name and a value of the object.
Now the prototype knows about its "children". We used the term subObject
to mean such named objects.
<p></p>
With no argument, 
returns true if <code>this</code> is a named new object and that name is a
property in <code>this.prototype</code> with a value of this.<br/>
In other words: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> this == this.prototype[this.name]</code>
Example:<br/>
<code>newObject({prototype: Root, name: "junk"}).isSubObject()</code> => <samp>true</samp>
<p></p>
With an argument, the argument is the presumed prototype of this.
If the argument is this's prototype, and the prototype has a field in it named the same as this, 
and its value is this, then isSubObect returns true.<br/>
Example:<br/>
<code>newObject({prototype: Root, name: "junk"}).isSubObject(Root)</code> => <samp>true</samp>
<br/>
</details>

<details id="isA_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>isA</summary>
Returns true if <code>this</code> is the same as or is
an ancestor of the argument.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
    <code>newObject({name: "junk"}).isA(Root)</code> => <samp>true</samp><br/>
        <code>newObject({name: "junk"}).isA(123)</code> => <samp>false</samp>
</details>

<details id="siblings_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>siblings</summary>
Returns an array of the siblings of <code>this</code>.
These will be the named objects that have the same prototype as <code>this</code>.<br/>
<i>Parameter</i><br/>
<b>include_this</b> Default: false. If true, returns an array of <i>all</i> the
   named objects that have the same prototype as <code>this</code>.
   If false, excludes <code>this</code> from the returned array.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
    <code>Root.siblings()</code> => <samp>[]</samp> //the root never has siblings.
</details>

<details id="Object.areSiblings_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>areSiblings</summary>
Returns true if all arguments have the same prototype,
Otherwise returns false.
<i>Examples:</i>
<code>Object.areSiblings(newObject({}), newObject({}))</code> => <samp>true</samp><br/>
<code>Object.areSiblings(newObject({}), "hey")</code> => <samp>false</samp></br/>
</details>

<details id="inheritsPropertyFrom_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>inheritsPropertyFrom</summary>
Returns the closest ancestor to <code>this</code> that contains the
property named by the string in the argument. If <code>this</code>
happens to have that name as a property, <code>this</code> will be returned.<br/>
Returns <code>null</code> if no such prop name.
<i>Examples:</i><br/>
<code>newObject({}).inheritsPropertyFrom("Coor")</code> => <samp>Root</samp><br/>
<code>newObject({}).inheritsPropertyFrom("isn't a prop name")</code> => <samp>null</samp>
</code>
</details>

<details id="ancestors_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>ancestors</summary>
Returns an array of the ancestors of <code>this</code>.<br/>
Does not include <code>this</code> in the returned array.<br/>
<i>Examples:</i><br/><
    <code>newObject().ancestors()</code> => <samp>[Root]</samp>
</details>

<details id="Object.allCommonAncestors_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>allCommonAncestors</summary>
Returns an array of all the ancestors that the arguments have in common.<br/>
<i>Examples:</i><br/>
    <code>Object.allCommonAncestors(newObject(), newObject())</code> => <samp>[Root]</samp>
</details>

<details id="Object.lowestCommonAncestor_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>lowestCommonAncestor</summary>
Returns the lowest common ancestor of the arguments. If none, return null.
<i>Examples:</i><br/>
    <code>Object.lowestCommonAncestor(newObject(), newObject())</code> => <samp>Root</samp>
</details>

<details id="normal_keys_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>normal_keys</summary>
Returns an array of property names in, or inherited by, <code>this</code>.<br/>
<i>Parameters</i><br/>
<b>passing no args</b> Allowing all 4 args to default to false.<br/>
Example: <code>Root.vehicle.normal_keys()</code> => <samp>["color", "weight"]</samp><br/>
<b>include_inherited</b> Property names of all ancestors excluding Root are in the resulting array.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code>Root.vehicle.normal_keys(true)</code> => <samp>["color", "weight"]</samp><br/>
<b>include_functions</b> Those properties whose values are functions are included.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code>Root.vehicle.normal_keys(true, true)</code> => <samp>["color", "weight", "launch"]</samp><br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
<b>include_subobject_names</b> The names of the subObjects will be included.
These will be siblings, uncles, great uncles, etc. but not cousins.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code>Root.vehicle.normal_keys(true, true, true)</code> => <samp>["color", "weight", "boat", "launch"]</samp><br/>
<b>include_name_and_prototype</b> The keys "'name" and "prototype" will be included.<br/>
The default is <code>false</code>.<br/>
Example: <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> Root.vehicle.normal_keys(true, true, true, true)</code> => <samp>["color", "weight"  "name", "prototype"]</samp>
<p></p>
Note that you shouldn't depend on the order of the elements in the result array.
If you want to force them into a consistent order, you can sort them alphabetically.
<p></p>
The use of "normal" in this method's name indicates that by passing no args,
it gets you what you'll most likely want, and passing in more and more <code>true</code> arguments
gets you more of the less-frequently used properties. (Your milage may vary,
but thats the general idea behind the name.)
</details>

<details id="objectPath_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>objectPath</summary>
Returns a string of the path to <code>this</code> such as
<code>"Root.animal.lion"</code><br/> Evaluating the returned string
will result in the object.<br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
    <code>newObject({name: "junk"}).objectPath()</code> => <samp>"Root.junk"</samp><br/>
    <code>eval("Root.junk").objectPath()</code> => <samp>"Root.junk"</samp>
</details>

<details id="sourceCode_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>sourceCode</summary>
Returns a string of source code for <code>this</code>.
Using the default values for the args,
evaluating the returned string will return a copy of <code>this</code>, but see below.<br/><br/>
<i>Parameters:</i> (All keywords.)<br/>

   If <code>true</code>, prints all the properties
   of <code title="unEVALable">this</code> other than the subobjects.

   if they have names, they are printed as their full paths.
   If they don't have names, the full source of the object is printed.<br/>
<b>include_subobjects</b> A boolean. Default: <code>true</code>.
   If <code>true</code>, prints the subojects of <code title="unEVALable">this</code>,
   all the way down.<br/>
   <br/>
<i>Example:</i><br/>
    <code>newObject({name: "junk", weight: 123}).sourceCode()</code> =>
    <pre><samp>"newObject({
  prototype: Root,
  name: "junk",
  weight: 123
})"</samp></pre>
If both include_this and include_subojects are <code>false</code>, the empty string will be returned.<br/>

    <details id="dde_version_between_doc_id"class="doc_details"><summary>dde_version_between</summary>
     A call to this method is meant to go above code that you want to declare the
     version of DDE that it can safely run in.<br/>
     <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
     <b>min</b> Default: <code>null</code> If dde_version is equal to or higher than min,
         this clause is satisfied.
         A <code>null</code> means there is no minimum and this clause will always be
         satisfied. <br/>
     <b>max</b> Default: <code>null</code> If dde_version is equal to or less than max,
        this clause will be satisfied.
        A <code>null</code> means there is no maximum, and this clause will always be
        satisfied.<br/>
        If both min and max are <code>null</code>, this function errors.<br/>
      <b>action</b> <code>"error"</code>, <code>"warn"</code> or a boolean . Default: <code>"error"</code>. <br/>
        If both min and max are satisfied, this function returns <code>true</code>.
         Otherwise, the behavior depends on the value of the action argument.<br/>
        If <code>"error"</code>, this function will error.<br/>
        If <code>"warn"</code>, this function will print a warning message and
        return <code>false</code><br/>
        If <code>"boolean"</code>, return </code>true</code> if dde_version is between min and max (inclusive) or
        </code>false</code> if it is not.
        <p></p>

    </details>
    <details id="patch_until_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>patch_until</summary>
        Function calls to <i>patch_until</i> are meant to surround
        code that is to be evaled conditionally based on what version of
        DDE you are running.
        <p></p>
        The primary use case is that there is a
        fix to some bug made in a later version of DDE, and
        you need that fix in your code, <i>but</i> you are not
        ready to switch to the new version yet. By using patch_until,
        you can have the patch code evaluated only if the dde_version
        is less than the version passed in to <i>patch_until</i>.
        <p></p>
        This allows you to include the call to <i>patch_until</i> in your code,
        (such as your dde_init.js file) and it will automatically be
        ignored when you run an equal to or higher version of DDE than in the <i>version</i>
        argument to <i>patch_until</i>.<br/>
        <i>patch_until</i> thus allows you to switch back and forth between
        dde versions and not have to change your dde_init.js file (or other code)
        to include or exclude "patches".
        <p></p>
        The function is so named because the source code in the first argument
        is a valid patch for DDE versions up to (i.e. until) the
        version number in the 2nd argument.<br/>
        <i>Parameters:</i><br/>
        <b>before_source</b> Default: <code>null</code>
        If the current version of dde (stored in <code>dde_version</code>)
        is less than the 2nd argument, and
        before_source is a string, then before_source is passed to <code>eval</code>
        and the result is returned. In the case that before_source is <code>null</code>
        (the default), it is ignored.<br/>
        <b>version</b> The version that is compared to <code>dde_version</code>.<br/>
        <b>equal_and_after_source</b> Default: <code>null</code>.
        If the current version of dde
        is more than or equal to the 2nd argument, equal_and_after_source is passed to
        <code>eval</code>
        and the result is returned. In the case that equal_and_after_source is null(the default),
        it is ignored.<br/>
        <i>Example:</i><br/>
        <code>patch_until("1 + 2", "1000.0.0", "4 + 5")</code><br/>
        => <samp>3</samp><br/>
        In the above example, until the dde_version exceeds "1000.0.0",
        the above code will return <code>3</code> i.e. the result of evaling
        the first arg.
        When dde_version is "1000.0.0" or higher, this call will return <code>9</code>,
        i.e. the result of evaling the third arg.
        <p></p>
        Since <i>patch_until</i> is just a funtion that returns a value,
        it can be embedded in other definitions, etc.
        But its most common use case is to declare that a given
        function definition (in the first argument) is to be used
        when the version number in the second argument is
        more than the current dde_version.
        In the normal case, the 3rd argument wouldn't be passed,
        because the function defined in the first argument
        is built-in to versions of DDE that are equal to or higher than the
        version in the second argument.
        <p></p>
        Note that <i>patch_until</i> was introduced in DDE 2.4.4, so
        calls to it will error in earlier versions of DDE.

        <p></p>
        Robots need sensors to understand their environment. A very useful sensor
        is a camera. However, scene recognition is one of the more complex cognitive tasks
        that humans do. Its no different for Robots.
        <p></p>
        The most widely used vision software for Robotics is called <i>OpenCV</i>.
        OpenCV is large and complex; necessary characteristics for the task.
        DDE uses a new version of OpenCV called opencv.js, a verison of the
        original C++ program that has been transpiled into JavaScript.
        DDE's opencv.js (as of Sept, 2017) corresponds to OpenCV version 3.3.
        That version of OpenCV was released in August 2017.
        opencv.js allows you to use JavaScript calls to access most of the funtionality
        in OpenCV. It does not yet support all of OpenCV, but work is ongoing to
        add functionality.
        <p></p>
        <b id="cv_doc_id">cv</b> opencv.js functions are available
        from the <code title="unEVALable">cv</code> global variable,
        which can be initialized via:<br/>
        <code>var cv = require("opencv.js")</code><br/>
        The first time you do this after launching DDE will take several seconds.
        The rest of the times it is very quick, so no harm in calling it
        more than once.
        <p></p>
        <i>Examples:</i><br/>
        DDE's Insert menu/Machine Vision submenu has examples of
        capturing pictures and video from a webcam, modifying images
        and blob detection for object identification.
        <p></p>
        DDE is in the early stages of using opencv.js. More to come.
        <p></p>
        <b>Depth Perception</b><br/>
        Many applications in Robotics need 3D scene understanding.
        OpenCV has some tools for processing stereo-pair images for
        sensing depth. It is also possible to mount a single camera on Dexter
        and have it take pictures at different locations to give you a stereo pair.
        <p></p>
        Probably using a camera that has build-in depth sensing is the best technique.
        Intel's <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html" target="_blank">RealSense</a>
        cameras are a good bet here. There is software to integrate the output of the RealSense cameras
        and OpenCV, though at this point (Aug. 2017) they are add-ons to OpenCV, not part of the
        core software. See Intel
        <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/realsense/camera-sdk/v1.1/documentation/html/index.html?doc_essential_image_data.html"
            target="_blank">documentation</a>.
        <p></p>
        <b>Performance</b><br/>
        Computer vision tends to eat up a lot of memory and processor power.
        Modern laptops can keep up for simple tasks, but the faster the machine and the
        more memory you have, the better, especially when processing video.
        <p></p>
        <b>OpenCV Help</b><br/>
        Because opencv.js is brand new, most of the documentation you will find
        has examples in C++. opencv.js uses very similar or identical names
        so with a bit of effort, you can make sense of C++ documentation. There
        are also bindings of OpenCV for Python, in case that's easier for you.
        <p></p>
        The most definitive guide is
        <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044765.do" target="_blank">Learning OpenCV 3</a>.
        At 1024 pages, this isn't a quick read, but that length is necessary to
        describe the considerable functionality. <a href="http://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV.org</a>
        has tons of useful information.
        <p></p>
        Documentation on opencv.js is sparser.
        First, understand the DDE opencv examples on the Insert menu/Machine Vision.
        Then, you can use DDE's inspector on <code title="unEVALable">cv</code>
        to see available constants and function names. Beware, there are over
        1K properties in this object!
        Next, take a look at: <a href="https://huningxin.github.io/opencv_docs/tutorial_js_root.html" target="_blank">
         opencv.js docs</a>/  A crucial document within that last url is a
         <a href="https://huningxin.github.io/opencv_docs/d5/df1/tutorial_js_some_data_structures.html"
            target="_blank">"cheat sheet"</a> of
         data structures that will help you convert C++ examples of using OpenCV to
         opencv.js compatible syntax.
         <p></p>
         <b>Converting C++ to JS</b><br/>
         In addition to the above examples and "cheat sheet", you will find the following
         tips useful in converting C++ examples to opencv.js<br/>
         <ul>
         <li>C++ is a strongly typed language so all variables and
         function parameters have type declarations. JS does not.<br/>
         C++ <code title="unEVALable">cv::Mat foo = cv::imread(...)</code> =><br/>
         JS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<samp>let foo = cv.imread(...)</samp> </li>
         <li>For functions and variables, generally<br/>
         C++ <code title="unEVALable">cv::foo</code> =><br/>
         JS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<samp title="unEVALable">cv.foo</samp> <i>except ...</i></li>
         <li>C++ does not use <samp>new</samp>
         in front of types to create an instance like JS.<br/>
         C++ <code title="unEVALable">cv::Size()</code> =><br/>
          JS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<samp>new cv.Size()</samp><br/>
         Similarly for <samp>Mat</samp>, <samp>Scalar</samp>, <samp>Point</samp>.
         </li>
         <li>opencv.js functions have the same signature as their C++ counterparts.
         This includes parameter names, types and default values.
         </li>
         <li> <code title="unEVALable">Scalar</code> usually refers to a number.
         In OpenCV and opencv.js,
         it refers to an array of 4 numbers. It is often employed to represent
         a pixel, with numbers for red, green, blue and alpha (transparency) (RGBA).
         It can also be used for any other group of 4 numbers.</li>
         <li> In normal Javascript, an automatic garbage collector deletes no-longer used objects from memory.
              C++ doesn't have an automatic garbage collector built-in so the user must delete unused objects.
              In opencv.js, the user is responsible for deleting large objects such as
              those of type <code title="unEVALable">Mat</code> used
              for images, including anything created with <code title="unEVALable">new cv.  ...</code>
              <i>Example:</i>
              <pre><code title="unEVALable">let mat = new cv.Mat()
//some code
mat.delete()</code></pre>
         </li>
         </ul>
         <b>Acknowledgement</b><br/>
         opencv.js was created by Sajjad Taheri and his collegues at the University of California, Irvine,
         supported by Intel Corporation. We greatly appreciate this valuable contribution
         to robotics and makers everywhere.

    <details id="make_html_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>make_html</summary>
    Normal web programing causes you to have to learn several different syntaxes
    for the same kind of gramatical constructs. The most common examples are
    JavaScript, HTML and CSS, all of which have their own needlessly
    different syntaxes for encoding name-value pairs. DDE primarily uses JavaScript, but
    programmers needing to create user interfaces in DDE must employ
    HTML and CSS for the content of
    <a href="#" onclick="open_doc(show_window_doc_id)">show_window</a>.
    <p></p>
    <code>make_html</code> relieves a programmer from having to know the
    ideosynracies of HMTL and CSS by providing a flexible way to create
    HTML and CSS source code using pure JS syntax. You can still use
    pure HTML and CCS if you like, but the advantages of make_html are:
    <ol><li>You don't have to know HTML & CSS punctuation.</li>
        <li>It makes it easier to embedded JS computed values into the HTML & CSS
             (better than string concat).</li>
        <li>You don't have to remember what's an HTML property and what's a CSS
            property.</li>
        <li>Error checking for HTML tags, HTML properties, and CSS properties
             (which browsers don't do ...one of their worst "features")
            while maintaining the flexibility to include non-standard terms
            if you really want to.</li>
     </ol>
     <i>Example:</i>
     <pre><code> let size = Math.pow(5, 2) + "px"
 make_html("b",
           {"font-size":size, color:"red", title:"big font"},
           "text")    </code></pre> =>
     <samp>'&lt;b title="big font" style="font-size":25px; color:red;"&gt;text&lt;/b&gt;'</samp>
     <p></p>
     <i>Parameters</i><br/>
     <b>tag</b> One of the 100+ tags in HTML. If you have a non-standard tag,
        make_html will warn or error depending on the value of the "error"
        parameter.<br/>
        <i>Examples:</i> <code>"b"</code>, <code>"details"</code>
     <p></p>
     <b>properties</b> Default: <code>{}</code>.  name-value pairs of
     HTML and/or CSS properties as a JS object. <br/>
     <i>Example:</i>
     <pre><code>{href:"hdrobotic.com",
 "font-size":"12px"}</code></pre>
     Note that you don't (usually) have to declare whether a property
     is HTML or CSS. Also note that property names that have hyphens in them
     must be quoted, as per JS.
     <p></p>
     DDE uses a database of HTML and CSS to help determine whether a given
     property is HTML or CSS. There are over 100 of each.
     There are 5 property names used by both HTML and CSS:<br/>
        <code title="unEVALable">border</code>,
        <code title="unEVALable">color</code>,
        <code title="unEVALable">content</code>,
        <code title="unEVALable">height</code>,
        <code title="unEVALable">width</code>.<br/>
        Fortunately most HTML tags can't accept any of these properties and
        DDE knows which ones. The precise algorithm for determining
        whether an attribute is HTML or CSS is complex, through for the above
        properties, make_html prefers CSS over HTML. DDE prints out
        warning or error messages when it is unconfident. See the "error" parameter.
        <p></p>
        You can guarentee that a property is a style by
        including it in a property named <code title="unEVALable">style</code>,
        just as you would in normal HTML. The style property can take a string
        of CSS for its value, just like in normal syntax.<br/>
        <i>Example:</i><pre><code>make_html("b",
          {style:"color:blue;height:123;"},
          "text")</code></pre>
        Style can ALSO take a JS Object as a value.<br/>
        <i>Example:</i><br/>
        <pre><code>make_html("b",
          {style: {color: "blue", height: 123}},
          "text")</code></pre>
        <p></p>
        If you want to force a property to be HTML, you can use a similar trick,
        through you have to use a property name that's NOT standard HTML.<br/>
        The 'string' verison of this uses HTML property syntax:<br/>
        <i>Example:</i><br/>
        <pre><code>make_html("b",
          {html_properties:"color=blue height=123"},
          "text")</code></pre>
        The object version uses JS object syntax:<br/>
        <i>Example:</i><br/>
        <pre><code>make_html("b",
          {html_properties: {color: "blue", height: 123}},
          "text")</code></pre>
        Properties whose name starts with <code title="unEVALable">data-</code>
        will be treated as an HTML property by default.
     <p></p>
     <b>innerHTML</b> Default: <code>""</code>. The text for
     the content of the tag. Can also be any function that computes a string,
     such as another <code>make_html</code> call
      (or several if you concat their results together).
     <p></p>
     <b>ending</b> Default: <code>"auto"</code> Determines
     the ending of the result string of HTML. Leaving off endings helps programmers
     make partial HTML elements to be used in further dynamic code generation.
     The result string has all HTML properties before any CSS (style) properties.<br/>
     An ending of:<br/>
     <code>"auto"</code> makes an
     ending of <code title="unEVALable">/&gt;</code> if the innerHTML argument
     is <code>""</code> (its default), and otherwise uses <code title="unEVALable">&lt;/tag&gt;</code>.<br/>
     <code>"none"</code> If there are any style properties,
     the last character of the result is the ending semicolon of the last style property.
     If there are only HTML properties, the last character of the result is the end double_quote
     of the last HTML property.<br/>
     <code>"end_style_only"</code> If there are any style properties,
     the last character of the result is the end double_quote of the style properties.
     If there are only HTML properties, the ending double quote of the last HTML property ends the result.<br/>
     <code>"short"</code> The last character of the result will be the &gt; that
     ends the properties of an HTML call.<br/>
     <code>"long"</code> The result will end with <code title="unEVALable">&lt;tag&gt;</code>
     <p></p>
     <b>error</b> Default: <code>false</code> A boolean.
     If <code>true</code>, this call to make_html will error
     if it is passed an invalid HTML tag, invalid HMTL property,
     or invalid CSS property.
     If <code>false</code>, this call will print a warning in the
     Output pane but allow make_html to return normally invalid HTML.
     The error/warning messages are very explicit about what's wrong.
     <p></p>
     When debugging calls to make_html, its useful to check the Output pane checkbox
     <br>Code</b> to see the returned HTML.

    <details id="make_dom_elt_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>make_dom_elt</summary>
        Same as <code>make_html</code> except that it returns a DOM element instead of
        a string. That DOM element can be used with all JS functions that manipulate
        DOM elememts. <br/>
        <i>Example:</i>
        <code>make_dom_elt("span", {color:"blue"}, "hi")</code>

        <details class="doc_details"><summary>Mouse Input</summary>
    <b>Position</b><br/>
    Javascript doesn't have just a method you can call to get the mouse position.
    JS does support getting the mouse position from an event.
    Below is code you can evaluate to keep global variables updated to
    the current mouse position.<br/>
    <pre><code title="not in TestSuite">document.addEventListener('mousemove',
            function(e){window.mouse_x = e.clientX
                        window.mouse_y = e.clientY})
         </code></pre>
     With the above code evaluated, you can then eval<br/>
      <code title="not in TestSuite">mouse_x</code> and/or <code title="not in TestSuite">mouse_y</code>
      to get the current mouse position as a non-negative integer
      from the upper left of the DDE window.
      <p></p>
      You can extend the function definition above to perform an action
      every time the mouse moves.
      <p></p>
      <b>Clicks</b><br/>
      You can cause a function to be called every time a mouse button is clicked via:
      <pre><code title="not in TestSuite">
document.addEventListener("click", function(e){
    let x      = e.clientX
    let y      = e.clientY
    let button = e.button //left=0, middle=1, right=2
    console.log("x: " + x + " y: " + y + " button: " + button)
});</code></pre>

        <i>Parameters</i><br/>
        <b>title</b> A string of the HTML displayed in the window's title bar. Default: "DDE Information"<br/>
        <b>width</b> The number of pixels wide that the window will be. Default: 400.
                     Minimum 100: Maximum: <code>window.outerWidth</code><br/>
        <b>height</b> The number of pixels tall that the window will be. Default: 400.
                      Minimum: 50, Maximum: <code>window.outerHeight</code><br/>
         <b>resizable</b> Boolean, default: <code>true</code>. Unfortunately the
         widget library we're using to implement show_window follows the web convention
         of making the drag areas for resizing tiny and thus hard to use.
         Hover the mouse on the inside but very close to any edge of the window
         to see a little arrow pop up indicating that you can press the mouse down and drag
         to resize the window.
         Dragging any corner corner is possible but even harder.<br/>
        <b>x</b> The number of pixels that the left edge of the window will be from the left edge of the DDE window.
        Default: 200 . Minimum: 0 positions window at left of DDE window.<br/>
        <b>y</b> The number of pixels that the top edge of the window will be from the top edge of the DDE window.
        Default: 200. Minimum: 0 positions window at top of the DDE window.<br/>
        <b>is_modal</b> A boolean. Default: <code>false</code>
         If <code>true</code>, prevents you from interacting with other windows.<br/>
        <b>show_close_button</b> A boolean. Default: <code>true</code>.
           Show or hide the "X" in the upper right of the window's title bar.<br/>
        <b>show_collapse_button</b> A boolean. Default: <code>true</code>.
         Allow quick shrink of window with a triangle icon near the upper right of the window's title bar.<br/>
        <b>trim_strings</b> A boolean. Default: <code>true</code>.
         Remove whitespace from beginning and end of values from inputs of type text and texareas.<br/>
        <b>background_color</b> Default: <code>"rgb(238, 238, 238)"</code> (gray).
          A string representing a color. Symbolic names like "ivory" can be used as well as
          Hexidecimal values like <code>"#EEAAEE"</code> (magenta).<br/>
         <b>close_same_titled_windows</b> A boolean, default: <code>true</code>.
         When true, all windows created with show_window with the same title
         as the one being created will be closed. The new window will have
         its x, y, width, and height parameters set to the latest show_window created
         that is still open. This allows the user to position and resize the window
         how they want it, and that will be preserved when another such window
         is created. To reset a window's x, y, width, height to their defaults,
         just close all such titled windows before opening a new one.<br/>
         To have two or more windows with the same title open at once,
         set this argument to <code>false</code>.<br/>
        <b>content</b> HTML to be rendered in the body of the window. Input tags with
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> type</code>
        attributes of <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> button</code> and
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> submit</code> will cause the window's
        callback function to be called.
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> submit</code> will also cause the window to be closed.<p></p>
        HTML elements with a class of "clickable" will behave as a button. Clicking on them
        will cause the window's callback button to be called with a
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> clicked_button_value</code>
        property of the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> name</code>, or if none, the
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> id</code> of the clicked on element.
        Clicking on such HTML elements will <i>not</i> close the window.<br/>
        <i>Example</i>:<br/>
        <pre><code>show_window({
    content:'&lt;p id="p_id" class="clickable">some para&lt;/p>',
    callback: function (vals){ append_in_ui("p_id", "&lt;h1>hey&lt;/h1>")}
})    </code></pre>
        <a href="#" onclick="open_doc(make_html_doc_id)">make_html</a> has a lot of advantages for creating HTML,
        many of which are not apparent from this simple example:
<pre><code>show_window({
    content: make_html("p", {"font-size": Math.pow(6, 2) + "px"}, "some para")
            })    </code></pre>
        <b>callback</b> A function of one argument. Any returned value will be ignored.
        It will be called when the user clicks a button in
        a show_window. It's argument will be a literal object. Many of its properties are x and y positions
        relative to the top-left of html elements in or containing the clicked position.
        <p></p>
        Others of its properties will be names and the corresponding values of input elements
        designated in the <i>content</i> argument. The actual "name" used for such an element
        is: <br/>If the element has a "name" properties, use the value of that.<br/>
        else if the element has an "id" property, use that. Note that "id" properties
        become global variables bound to the element, which can be useful
        if you want to programatically change them.<br/>
        else if the element has a "value" property, use that. Note that an
        "input" element of type "button" will have its displayed label be
        the value of its "value" property.
        <p></p>
        <i>Example </i> of an argument passed to the callback function:<br/><pre>
<code>{x: 300,           //relative to the parent of the elt clicked on
 y: 213,
 clientX: 300,      //relative to the content area (the viewport) of the browser window
 clientY: 213,      //This point does not move even if the user moves a scrollbar from within the browser.
 offsetX: 290,      //relative to the html element that the user clicked in
 offsetY: 68,
 pageX: 300,        //relative to the top left of the fully rendered content area in the browser.
 pageY: 213,
 screenX: 395,      //relative to the physical display
 screenY: 270,
 altKey: false,     //true if the alt key (option on Mc) was pressed when the mouse was clicked
 ctrlKey: false,    //control key
 metaKey: false,    //Windows key on Windows OS, command key on Mac
 shiftKey: false,
 tagName: "input",  //html element tag clicked on.
 window_index: "1", //a show_window instance identifier.
                   //close_window(window_index)
                   //will close the show_window window.
 clicked_button_value: "my_in_id", //the 'name' or 'id' attribute of the clicked on element.
 trim_strings: true}</code></pre>
        <i>Example callback that is called when a button is clicked:</i>
<pre><code>function show_vals(vals){out(vals)} //this is, effectively, the default callback
show_window({
    content:
&#96;text: &lt;input type="text" name="my_text" value="Dexter"/>&lt;br/>
textarea: &lt;textarea name="my_textarea">Hi Rez&lt;/textarea>&lt;br/>

    callback: show_vals})  </code></pre>
    <span style="color:red;">Beware</span>: The callback function cannot be a closure.
    It can be an annonymous function, but its really better if it has a top level name.
    This restriction is due to implementation complexities with show_window.<br/>

    <b>init_elt_id</b> Default: <code>null</code>
    If this is a string, it is expected to be the id of an html input element
    in the content. After the window is created, an automatic programmatic click on
    the named element is performed such that the callback of this show_window
    is called. The "clicked_button_value" for this click will be the
    value of init_elt_id.
    <p></p>
    init_elt_id is not commonly needed, but when you'd like to do some
    initialization of the show_window that needs the default values of the inputs,
    this argument is quite useful.<br/>
    <i>Example:</i>
    <pre><code title="not in testsuite"/>function handle_my_win(vals){
    if(vals.clicked_button_value == "init_my_win_id"){
        out("initing my_win")
    }
}
show_window({
    content: `&lt;input type="button" id="init_my_win_id" value="init"/>`,
    init_elt_id:"init_my_win_id",
    callback: handle_my_win,
})
        </code></pre>
    This example calls the init code when the window first comes up and
    when the user clicks on the init button. If you want to exclude the
    user from seeing the init button, change the content to:<br/>
    <code title="not in testsuite">&lt;input type="button" id="init_my_win_id" style="display:none;"/&gt;</code>

    <h4>click</h4> You can programmatically click on an html input like so:<br/>
    <code title="not in testsuite">init_my_win_id.click()</code><br/>
    This will cause the callback in the previous example to be called
    with a vals.clicked_button_value of <code>"init_my_win_id"</code>.

    <h4>onchange</h4>
    Normally the callback is only called when the user clicks a button. However,
    you can get the callback to be called for any input HTML tag if you give it
    an attribute of<br/> <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> data-onchange='true' </code><br/>
    clicking on another element or tabbing away from an element you just changed
    will cause the callback function to be called.
    <p></p>
    You can have the callback function for any modification of the value of an element
    by adding the HTML attribute:<br/>
    <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> data-oninput='true'</code><br/>
    For text boxes, this activates on each character typed in.
    For range sliders, this acticvates many times as you are dragging the slider.

    <h4>Cover DDE Window</h4>
    To have a show_window cover the entire DDE window:
    <pre><code title="not in TestSuite"> show_window({content: "hi",
             x: 0,
             y: 0,
             width:  window.outerWidth,
             height: window.outerHeight})
    </code></pre>
    <p></p>
    For more examples of calling <code>show_window</code> see the DDE menubar/Insert/show_window.

            Closes a window created with show_window.<br/>
            <i>Parameter:</i><br/>
            <b>window_title_index_or_elt</b>: This can be either the title of the window (a string),
            a window index, or the jQuery window object.<br/>
            Calling <code>show_window</code> returns a window_index.
            When a show_window callback function is called, it will be passed a literal object
            with a property of <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> window_index</code>.
            These window_indexes can be passed
            to <code>close_window</code> to close the window. This is a non-negative integer.<p></p>
            <i>Example:</i> (from within a show_window callback function) <br/>
            <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> close_window(vals.window_index)</code><br/>
            Note that when a user clicks on an input of type "submit", that
            will automatically close the window with no need to call close_window explicitly.<br/>
            Also note that when show_window's close_same_titled_windows init arg is true
            (the default), same titled windows will automatically be cloaed.
            <p></p>
            If no argument is passed, the latest show_window is closed.<br/>
            <i>Example:</i> (from within a show_window callback function) <br/>
            <code title="not in test suite">close_window()</code>
            <p></p>
            If close_window is unable to find an open window specified in the argument,

    <details class="doc_details"><summary>SVG</summary>
        SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a way
        to draw 2D graphics on a web page. The drawn elements
        (circles, lines, etc.) are surrounded by a svg tag wrapper
        indicating the size of the drawing area. You can use
        svg tags directly in the content for a show_window.<p></p>
        The methods documented below create that html from JavaScript calls,
        facilitating dynamic content creation as well as
        making static svg shapes a little easier to create.<p></p>
        <i>Parameters for all svg functions</i>:<br/>
        <b>id</b> The html id of the element, useful in calls to window utility functions
        such as <code>append_in_ui</code>.<br/>
        <b>html_class</b>: Used to set the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> class</code> attrbute of the element.
        Due to a name conflict with <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> class</code> in JavaScript, we had to name this
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> html_class</code>.<br/>
        <b>style</b>: A string setting the css style of the element. Note that some
        arguments to svg functions are actually rendered as style attributes, such as
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> color</code>,
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> border_color</code>,
        <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> border_width</code>.

        <details id="svg_svg_doc_id" class="doc_details"><summary>svg_svg</summary>
            svg shapes must be drawn as child elements of an <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> svg</code> element.
            The x and y of those child elements is relative to the upper left corner of
            the containing svg element. So for instance, if you draw a circle with
            x: 0, y: 0, you will see only the lower right corner of the circle
            in the upper left corner of the svg area.
            <i>Parameters</i> <br/>
            <b>width</b>:  Width  in pixels of the rectangle area to put svg shapes in.<br/>
            <b>height</b>: Height in pixels of the rectangle area to put svg shapes in.<br/>
            <b>viewBox</b>: A string of four space_separated numbers that controls the scale and positioning
            of the contained svg elements.<br/>
            <b>child_elements</b>: Default: <code>[]</code>. An array of strings of the html for
            svg shapes. Usually these strings should be created with the svg shape creator functions
            such as <code>svg_circle</code>. <p></p>
            <i>Example</i>:<pre><code title="not in TestSuite"> show_window({
   content:svg_svg({
       id:"s_id", width:500, height:200,
       html_class:"clickable",

            <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> class</code>
            and <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> style</code> arguments. If you desire these, they must be placed on the individual
            html tags within the value of the <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> html</code> argument. Note that
            here we need to spell the class attribute by its correct HTML name,
            <code title="unEVALable code fragment"> class</code>,
            not the special spelling used in the other svg functions of
